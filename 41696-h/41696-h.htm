<h3 class="p4">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>I have always wondered that woman could be
so glib in claiming equality with man. In
such trifling matters as politics and science and
industry, I doubt if there be much to choose
between the two sexes. But in the cultivation
and practice of an art which concerns life more
seriously, woman has hitherto proved an inferior
creature.</p>

<p>For centuries the kitchen has been her appointed
sphere of action. And yet, here, as in
the studio and the study, she has allowed man
to carry off the laurels. Vatel, Carême, Ude,
Dumas, Gouffé, Etienne, these are some of the
immortal cooks of history: the kitchen still
waits its Sappho. Mrs Glasse, at first, might
be thought a notable exception; but it is not so
much the merit of her book as its extreme rarity
in the first edition which has made it famous.</p>

<p>Woman, moreover, has eaten with as little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
distinction as she has cooked. It seems almost&mdash;much
as I deplore the admission&mdash;as if she
were of coarser clay than man, lacking the
more artistic instincts, the subtler, daintier
emotions.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, the great interest of the
following papers lies in the fact that they are
written by a woman&mdash;a greedy woman. The
collection, evidently, does not pretend to be a
"Cook's Manual," or a "Housewife's Companion":
already the diligent, in numbers, have
catalogued <i>recipes</i>, with more or less exactness.
It is rather a guide to the Beauty, the Poetry,
that exists in the perfect dish, even as in the
masterpiece of a Titian or a Swinburne.
Surely hope need not be abandoned when there
is found one woman who can eat, with understanding,
the Feasts of Autolycus.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE VIRTUE OF GLUTTONY</h2>

<p>Gluttony is ranked with the deadly sins; it
should be honoured among the cardinal virtues.
It was in the Dark Ages of asceticism that contempt
for it was fostered. Selfish anchorites,
vowed to dried dates and lentils, or browsing
Nebuchadnezzar-like upon grass, thought by
their lamentable example to rob the world of
its chief blessing. Cheerfully, and without a
scruple, they would have sacrificed beauty and
pleasure to their own superstition. If the
vineyard yielded wine and the orchard fruit, if
cattle were sent to pasture, and the forest
abounded in game, they believed it was that
men might forswear the delights thus offered.
And so food came into ill repute and foolish
fasting was glorified, until a healthy appetite
passed for a snare of the devil, and its gratification
meant eternal damnation. Poor deluded
humans, ever so keen to make the least of the
short span of life allotted to them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
With time, all superstitions fail; and asceticism
went the way of many another ingenious
folly. But as a tradition, as a convention,
somehow, it lingered longer among women.
And the old Christian duty became a new feminine
grace. And where the fanatic had fasted
that his soul might prove comelier in the sight
of God, silly matrons and maidens starved, or
pretended to starve, themselves that their bodies
might seem fairer in the eyes of man. And
dire, indeed, has been their punishment. The
legend was that swooning Angelina or tear-stained
Amelia, who, in company, toyed tenderly
with a chicken wing or unsubstantial
wafer, later retired to the pantry to stuff herself
with jam and pickles. And thus gradually,
so it is asserted, the delicacy of women's
palate was destroyed; food to her perverted
stomach was but a mere necessity to stay the
pangs of hunger, and the pleasure of eating
she looked upon as a deep mystery, into which
only man could be initiated.</p>

<p>In this there is much exaggeration, but still
much truth. To-day women, as a rule, think
all too little of the joys of eating. They hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
lightly the treasures that should prove invaluable.
They refuse to recognise that there is no
less art in eating well than in painting well or
writing well, and if their choice lay between
swallowing a bun with a cup of tea in an aërated
bread shop, and missing the latest picture
show or doing without a new book, they would
not hesitate; to the stodgy bun they would
condemn themselves, though that way madness
lies. Is it not true that the woman who would
economise, first draws her purse-strings tight
in the market and at the restaurant? With her
milliner's bill she may find no fault, but in
butcher's book, or grocer's, every halfpenny is
to be disputed.</p>

<p>The loss is hers, but the generous-hearted can
but regret it. Therefore let her be brought
face to face with certain fundamental facts,
and the scales will fall quickly from her eyes,
and she will see the truth in all its splendour.</p>

<p>First, then, let her know that the love of
good eating gives an object to life. She need
not stray after false gods; she will not burden
herself with silly fads, once she realizes that
upon food she may concentrate thought and energy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
and her higher nature&mdash;which to her
means so much&mdash;be developed thereby. Why
clamour for the suffrage, why labour for the
redemption of brutal man, why wear, with
noisy advertisement, ribbons white or blue,
when three times a day there is a work of art,
easily within her reach, to be created? All his
life a Velasquez devoted to his pictures, a
Shakespeare to his plays, a Wagner to his operas:
why should not the woman of genius spend
hers in designing exquisite dinners, inventing
original breakfasts, and be respected for the
nobility of her self-appointed task? For in the
planning of the perfect meal there is art; and,
after all, is not art the one real, the one
important thing in life?</p>

<p>And the object she thus accepts will be her
pleasure as well. For the <i>gourmande</i>, or glutton,
duty and amusement go hand in hand.
Her dainty devices and harmonies appeal to
her imagination and fancy; they play gently
with her emotions; they develop to the utmost
her pretty sensuousness. Mind and body alike
are satisfied. And so long as this pleasure endures
it will never seem time to die. The ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
philosopher thought that time had come
when life afforded more evil than good. The
good of a pleasantly planned dinner outbalances
the evil of daily trials and tribulations.</p>

<p>Here is another more intimate, personal reason
which the woman of sense may not set
aside with flippancy or indifference. By artistic
gluttony, beauty is increased, if not actually
created. Listen to the words of Brillat-Savarin,
that suave and sympathetic <i>gourmet</i>: "It
has been proved by a series of rigorously exact
observations that by a succulent, delicate, and
choice regimen, the external appearances of
age are kept away for a long time. It gives
more brilliancy to the eye, more freshness to
the skin, more support to the muscles; and as
it is certain in physiology that wrinkles, those
formidable enemies of beauty, are caused by
the depression of muscle, it is equally true
that, other things being equal, those who understand
eating are comparatively four years
younger than those ignorant of that science."
Surely he should have called it art, not science.
But let that pass. Rejoice in the knowledge
that gluttony is the best cosmetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
And more than this: a woman not only grows
beautiful when she eats well, but she is bewitchingly
lovely in the very act of eating.
Listen again, for certain texts cannot be heard
too often: "There is no more pretty sight than
a pretty <i>gourmande</i> under arms. Her napkin is
nicely adjusted; one of her hands rests on the
table, the other carries to her mouth little morsels
artistically carved, or the wing of a partridge,
which must be picked. Her eyes sparkle,
her lips are glossy, her talk cheerful, all
her movements graceful; nor is there lacking
some spice of the coquetry which accompanies
all that women do. With so many advantages
she is irresistible, and Cato, the censor himself,
could not help yielding to the influence." And
who shall say that woman, declaiming on the
public platform, or "spanking" progressive
principles into the child-man, makes a prettier
picture?</p>

<p>Another plea, and one not to be scorned, is
the new bond of union love of eating weaves
between man and wife. "A wedded pair with
this taste in common have once a day at least
a pleasant opportunity of meeting." Sport
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
has been pronounced a closer tie than religion,
but what of food? What, indeed? Let men
and women look to it that at table delicious
sympathy makes them one, and marriage will
cease to be a failure. If they agree upon their
sauces and salads, what matter if they disagree
upon mere questions of conduct and finance?
Accept the gospel of good living and the sexual
problem will be solved. She who first dares to
write the great Food Novel will be a true
champion of her sex. And yet women meet
and dine together, and none has the courage
to whisper the true secret of emancipation.
Mostly fools! Alas! that it should have to be
written!</p>

<p>And think&mdash;that is, if you know how to think&mdash;of
the new joy added to friendship, the new
charm to casual acquaintanceship, when food is
given its due, and is recognised as something
to be talked of. The old platitudes will fade
and die. The maiden will cease to ask "What
do you think of the Academy?" The earnest
one will no longer look to Ibsen for heavy
small talk. Pretence will be wiped away, conversational
shams abolished, and the social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
millennium will have come. Eat with understanding,
and interest in the dishes set before
you must prove genuine and engrossing, as enthusiasm
over the last new thing in art or
ethics has never been&mdash;never can be. The
sensation of the day will prove the latest arrangement
in oysters, the newest device in
vegetables. The ambitious will trust to her
kitchen to win her reputation; the poet will
offer lyrics and pastorals with every course;
the painter will present in every dish a lovely
scheme of colour.</p>

<p>Gross are they who see in eating and drinking
nought but grossness. The woman who
cannot live without a mission should now find
the path clear before her. Let her learn first
for herself the rapture that lies dormant in
food; let her next spread abroad the joyful tidings.
Gluttony is a vice only when it leads
to stupid, inartistic excess.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">A PERFECT BREAKFAST</h2>

<p>Breakfast means many things to many men.
Ask the American, and he will give as definition:
"Shad, beefsteak, hash, fried potatoes,
omelet, coffee, buckwheat cakes, waffles, corn bread,
and (if he be a Virginian) batter pudding,
at 8 o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> sharp." Ask the Englishman,
and he will affirm stoutly: "Tea, a
rasher of bacon, dry toast, and marmalade as
the clock strikes nine, or the half after." And
both, differing in detail as they may and do,
are alike barbarians, understanding nothing of
the first principles of gastronomy.</p>

<p>Seek out rather the Frenchman and his kinsmen
of the Latin race. They know: and to
their guidance the timid novice may trust herself
without a fear. The blundering Teuton,
however, would lead to perdition; for he, insensible
to the charms of breakfast, does away
with it altogether, and, as if still swayed by
nursery rule, eats his dinner at noon&mdash;and may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
he long be left to enjoy it by himself! Therefore,
in this, as in many other matters that
cater to the higher pleasures, look to France
for light and inspiration.</p>

<p>Upon rising&mdash;and why not let the hour vary
according to mood and inclination?&mdash;forswear
all but the <i>petit déjeuner</i>: the little breakfast of
coffee and rolls and butter. But the coffee
must be of the best, no chicory as you hope for
salvation; the rolls must be crisp and light and
fresh, as they always are in Paris and Vienna;
the butter must be pure and sweet. And if
you possess a fragment of self-respect, enjoy
this <i>petit déjeuner</i> alone, in the solitude of your
chamber. Upon the early family breakfast
many and many a happy marriage has been
wrecked; and so be warned in time.</p>

<p>At noon once more is man fit to meet his fellow-man
and woman. Appetite has revived.
The day is at its prime. By every law of nature
and of art, this, of all others, is the hour
that calls to breakfast.</p>

<p>When soft rains fall, and winds blow milder,
and bushes in park or garden are sprouting and
spring is at hand, grace your table with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
same sweet promise of spring. Let rosy radish
give the touch of colour to satisfy the eye, as
chairs are drawn in close about the spotless
cloth: the tiny, round radish, pulled in the
early hours of the morning, still in its first virginal
purity, tender, sweet, yet peppery, with
all the piquancy of the young girl not quite a
child, not yet a woman. In great bunches, it
enlivens every stall at Covent Garden, and
every greengrocer's window; on the breakfast-table
it is the gayest poem that uncertain
March can sing. Do not spoil it by adding
other <i>hors d'&oelig;uvres</i>; nothing must be allowed to
destroy its fragrance and its savour. Bread
and butter, however, will serve as sympathetic
background, and enhance rather than lessen its
charm.</p>

<p>Vague poetic memories and aspirations
stirred within you by the dainty radish, you
will be in fitting humour for <i>&oelig;ufs aux saucissons</i>,
a dish, surely, invented by the Angels in Paradise.
There is little earthly in its composition
or flavour; irreverent it seems to describe it in
poor halting words. But if language prove
weak, intention is good, and should others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
learn to honour this priceless delicacy, then
will much have been accomplished. Without
more ado, therefore, go to Benoist's, and buy the
little truffled French sausages which that temple
of delight provides. Fry them, and fry half the
number of fresh eggs. Next, one egg and two
sausages place in one of those irresistible little
French baking-dishes, dim green or golden
brown in colour, and, smothering them in rich
wine sauce, bake, and serve&mdash;one little dish
for each guest. Above all, study well your
sauce; if it fail, disaster is inevitable; if it succeed,
place laurel leaves in your hair, for you
will have conquered. "A woman who has
mastered sauces sits on the apex of civilisation."</p>

<p>Without fear of anti-climax, pass suavely on
from <i>&oelig;ufs aux saucissons</i> to <i>rognons sautés</i>. In
thin elegant slices your kidneys should be cut,
before trusting them to the melted butter in
the frying pan; for seasoning, add salt, pepper,
and parsley; for thickening, flour; for strength,
a tablespoonful or more of stock; for stimulus,
as much good claret; then eat thereof and you
will never repent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Dainty steps these to prepare the way for the
breakfast's most substantial course, which, to
be in loving sympathy with all that has gone
before, may consist of <i>côtelettes de mouton au naturel</i>.
See that the cutlets be small and plump,
well trimmed, and beaten gently, once on each
side, with a chopper cooled in water. Dip
them into melted butter, grill them, turning
them but once that the juice may not be lost,
and thank kind fate that has let you live to
enjoy so delicious a morsel. <i>Pommes de terre
sautées</i> may be deemed chaste enough to appear&mdash;and
disappear&mdash;at the same happy moment.</p>

<p>With welcome promise of spring the feast
may end as it began. Order a salad to follow:
cool, quieting, encouraging. When in its perfection
cabbage lettuce is to be had, none could
be more submissive and responsive to the wooing
of oil and vinegar. Never forget to rub
the bowl with onion, now in its first youth, ardent
but less fiery than in the days to come,
strong but less imperious. No other garniture
is needed. The tender green of the lettuce
leaves will blend and harmonise with the
anemones and tulips, in old blue china or dazzling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
crystal, that decorate the table's centre;
and though grey may be the skies without,
something of May's softness and June's radiance
will fill the breakfast-room with the
glamour of romance.</p>

<p>What cheese, you ask? Suisse, of course.
Is not the month March? Has not the <i>menu</i>,
so lovingly devised, sent the spring rioting
through your veins? Suisse with sugar, and
prolong the sweet dreaming while you may.
What if work you cannot, after thus giving the
reins to fancy and to appetite? At least you
will have had your hour of happiness. Breakfast
is not for those who toil that they may
dine; their sad portion is the midday sandwich.</p>

<p>Wine should be light and not too many. The
true epicure will want but one, and he may do
worse than let his choice fall upon Graves,
though good Graves, alas! is not to be had for
the asking. Much too heavy is Burgundy for
breakfast. If your soul yearns for red wine,
be aristocratic in your preferences, and, like
the Stuarts, drink Claret&mdash;a good St. Estèphe
or St. Julien.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Coffee is indispensable, and what is true of
coffee after dinner is true as well of coffee after
breakfast. Have it of the best, or else not at
all. For liqueur, one of the less fervent, more
maidenly varieties, Maraschino, perhaps, or
Prunelle, but make sure it is the Prunelle, in
stone jugs, that comes from Chalon-sur-Saône.
Bring out the cigarettes&mdash;not the Egyptian or
Turkish, with suspicion of opium lurking in
their fragrant recesses&mdash;but the cleaner, purer
Virginian. Then smoke until, like the Gypsy
in Lenau's ballad, all earthly trouble you have
smoked away, and you master the mysteries of
Nirvana.</p>

<h2 class="p4">TWO BREAKFASTS</h2>

<p>Spring is the year's playtime. Who, while
trees are growing green and flowers are budding,
can toil with an easy conscience? Later,
mere "use and wont" accustoms the most sensitive
to sunshine and green leaves and fragrant
blossoms. It is easy to work in the summer.
But spring, like wine, goes to the head and
gladdens the heart of man, so that he is fit for
no other duty than the enjoyment of this new
gladness. If he be human, and not a mere
machine, he must and will choose it for the
season of his holiday.</p>

<p>This is why in the spring the midday breakfast
appeals with most charm. It may be
eaten in peace, with no thought of immediate
return to inconsiderate desk or tyrannical easel.
A stroll in the park, a walk across the fields, or
over the hills and far away, should be the most
laborious labour to follow. It would be a
crime, indeed, to eat a dainty breakfast, daintily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
designed and served, in the bustle and nervous
hurry of a working day. But when the
sunny hours bring only new pleasure and new
capacity for it, what better than to break their
sweet monotony with a light, joyous feast that
worthily plays the herald to the evening's banquet?</p>

<p>It must be light, however: light as the sunshine
that falls so softly on spotless white linen
and flawless silver; gay and gracious as the
golden daffodils in their tall glass. The table's
ornaments should be few: would not the least
touch of heaviness mar the effect of spring?
Why, then, add to the daffodils? See, only,
that they are fresh, just plucked from the cool
green woodland, the morning dew still wet
and shining on their golden petals, and make
sure that the glass, though simple, is as shapely
as Venice or Whitefriars can fashion it.</p>

<p>Daffodils will smile a welcome, if radishes
come to give them greeting; radishes, round
and rosy and crisp; there is a separate joy in
the low sound of teeth crunching in their crispness.
Vienna rolls (and London can now supply
them) and rich yellow butter from Devon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
dairies carry out the scheme of the first garden-like
course.</p>

<p>Sweeter smiles fall from the daffodils, if now
they prove motive to a fine symphony in gold;
as they will if <i>omelette aux rognons</i> be chosen as
second course. Do not trust the omelet to
heavy-handed cook, who thinks it means a
compromise between piecrust and pancake. It
must be frothy, and strong in that quality of
lightness which gives the keynote to the composition
as a whole. Enclosed within its melting
gold, at its very heart, as it were, lie the
kidneys elegantly minced and seasoned with
delicate care. It is a dish predestined for the
midday breakfast, too beautiful to be wasted
on the early, dull, morning hours; too immaterial
for the evening's demands.</p>

<p>Its memory will linger pleasantly, even when
<i>pilaff de volaille à l'Indienne</i> succeeds, offering a
new and more stirring symphony in the same
radiant gold. For golden is the rice, stained
with curry, as it encircles the pretty, soft
mound of chicken livers, brown and delicious.
Here the breakfast reaches its one substantial
point; but meat more heavy would seem vulgar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and gross. The curry must not be too hot,
but rather gentle and genial like the lovely
May sunshine.</p>

<p>Now, a pause and a contrast. Gold fades
into green. As are the stalks to the daffodils,
so the dish of <i>petits pois aux laitues</i> to <i>pilaff</i> and
<i>omelette</i>. The peas are so young that no device
need be sought to disguise their age; later on,
like faded beauty, they may have recourse to
many a trick and a pose, but not as yet. The
lettuce, as unsophisticated, will but emphasise
their exquisite youth. It is a combination that
has all the wonderful charm of infant leaves
and tentative buds on one and the same branch
of the spring-fired bush.</p>

<p>No sweet. Would not the artifice of jellies
and cream pall after such a succession of Nature's
dear tributes? Surely the <i>menu</i> should
finish as it began, in entrancing simplicity.
Port Salut is a cheese that smells of the dairy;
that, for all its monastic origin, suggests the
pink and white Hetty or Tess with sleeves well
uprolled over curved, dimpling arms. Eat it
with Bath Oliver biscuits, and sigh that the
end should come so soon. Where the need to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
drag in the mummy at the close of the feast?
The ancients were wise; with the last course
does it not ever stare at you cruelly, with
mocking reminder that eating, like love, hath
an end?</p>

<p>Graves is the wine to drink with daffodil-crowned
feast&mdash;golden Graves, light as the
breakfast, gay as the sunshine, gladdening as
the spring itself. Coffee completes the composition
nobly, if it be black and strong. And
for liqueur, Benedictine, in colour and feeling
alike, enters most fittingly into the harmony.
Smoke cigarettes from Virginia, that southern
land of luxuriant spring flowers.</p>

<p>There is no monotony in spring sunshine;
why, then, let spring's breakfast always strike
the same monotonous note? Another day, another
mood, and so, as logical consequence,
another <i>menu</i>. From your own garden gather
a bunch of late tulips, scarlet and glowing, but
cool in their shelter of long tapering leaves.
Fill a bowl with them: it may be a rare bronze
from Japan, or a fine piece of old Delft, or anything
else, provided it be somewhat sumptuous
as becomes the blossoms it holds. Open with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
that triumph of colour which would have enchanted
a Titian or a Monticelli: the roseate
salmon of the Rhine, smoked to a turn, and cut
in thin slices, all but transparent. It kindles
desire and lends new zest to appetite.</p>

<p>After so ardent a preparation, what better
suited for ensuing course than <i>&oelig;ufs brouillés aux
pointes d'asperges</i>? the eggs golden and fleecy as
the clouds in the sunset's glow; the asparagus
points imparting that exquisite flavour which is
so essentially their own. Cloudlike, the loveliness
gradually and gracefully disappears, as
in a poet's dream or a painter's impression,
and spring acquires a new meaning, a new
power to enchant.</p>

<p>Who, with a soul, could pass on to a roast or
a big heating joint? More to the purpose is <i>ris
de veau à la Toulouse</i>, the sweetbreads broiled
with distinction, and then, in pretty fluted <i>caissons</i>,
surrounded with <i>Béchamel</i> sauce and ravishing
<i>ragoût</i> of mushrooms and cock's combs.
They are light as a feather, but still a trifle
flamboyant in honour of the tulips, while the
name carries with it gaiety from the gay southern
town of the <i>Jeux Floraux</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Next, a salad is not out of place. Make it
of tomatoes, scarlet and stirring, like some
strange tropical blossoms decking the shrine of
the sun. Just a suspicion of shallot in the
bowl; the perfect dressing of vinegar and oil,
pepper and salt; and the luxuriant tropics
could not yield a richer and more fragrant
offering. It is a salad that vies with Cleopatra
in its defiance to custom. Love for it grows
stronger with experience. The oftener it is
enjoyed the greater the desire to enjoy it again.</p>

<p>Why, then, venture to destroy the impression
it leaves with the cloying insipidity of
some ill-timed sweet? It is almost too early
for strawberries worth the eating, save in a
<i>macédoine</i>, and they alone would come next in
order, without introducing an element of confusion
in the well-proportioned breakfast of
spring. A savoury, too, would, at this special
juncture, have its drawbacks. Cheese again
best fulfils the conditions imposed. But now,
something stronger, something more definite
than Port Salut is called for; if Camembert
prove the cheese of your choice, there will be
no chance for criticism. One warning: see that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
it is ripe; for the Camembert that crumbles in
its dryness is nothing short of iniquitous.</p>

<p>Tulips and tomatoes point to Claret as the
wine to be drunk. Burgundy is for the evening,
when candles are lighted, and the hours of
dreaming have begun. St. Estèphe, at noon,
has infinite merit, and responds to the tulip's
call with greater warmth than any white wine,
whether from the vineyards of France or Germany,
of Hungary or Italy. Coffee, as a matter
of course, is to the elegantly-designed
breakfast what the Butterfly is to the Nocturne.
And when all is said, few liqueurs accord with
it so graciously as Cognac; that is, if the dishes
to precede it have tended to that joyful flamboyancy
born of the artist's exuberance in moments
of creation.</p>

<p>Eat either breakfast, or both; and be thankful
that spring comes once a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">THE SUBTLE SANDWICH</h2>

<p>If things yield themselves unto our mercy
why should we not have the fruition of them,
or apply them to our advantage? From evil,
good may come; from the little, springs greatness.
A reckless gamester, to defy the pangs
of hunger, which might drag him from his beloved
cards, brings to the gaming table slices
of bread with ham between. If other men
despise&mdash;or deplore, according to their passing
mood&mdash;his folly, to their own pleasure and
profit can they still turn his invention. The
sandwich has become a universal possession for
all time, though for a century the earl who
created it has lain dead. His foibles should be
forgotten, his one redeeming virtue remembered.
For him a fair and spacious niche in
the world's Valhalla.</p>

<p>A hero indeed is he who left the sandwich as
an heirloom to humanity. It truly is the staff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of life, a substantial meal for starving traveller
or bread-winner; but none the less an incomparable
work of art, a joy to the <i>gourmand</i> of
fancy and discretion. The very name has
come to be a pregnant symbol of holiday-making
for all with souls to stir at the thought of
food and drink. It is an inexhaustible stimulus
to the imagination; to the memory a tender
guide to the past's happiest days and hours.</p>

<p>For, in fancy, between the slices of bread,
place thick, uncompromising pieces of beef or
mutton, and to the Alps you are at once transported.
Again, on the short, fragrant grass
you sit; from its temporary snow-grave a little
above, Perren or Imboden fetches the bottle of
wine, ordinary enough in reality, nectar as you
drink it there; Seiler's supplies you take from
the faithful knapsack, opening paper package
after paper package; and your feast of big,
honest, no-nonsense-about-them sandwiches you
devour with the appetite of a schoolboy, and the
zeal of the convert to plain living and high
mountain climbing.</p>

<p>Or, thin the slices, make them the covering
for ham and tongue, or&mdash;if you be greatly favoured&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
sardines and anchovies; and then
memory will spread for you the banquet in the
pleasant pastures that border the Cam, the willows
bowering you from the August sun with
shade, your boat moored to the cool bank; and
with Claret cup, poured, mayhap, into old college
tankards, you quench your thirst, while
lazily you listen to the distant plashing of oars
and lowing of kine, and all life drifts into an
idle dream.</p>

<p>Or, the ham of Bayonne, the <i>pâté de foie gras</i>
of Périgueux, you bury in the deep recesses of
a long, narrow, crisp <i>petit pain</i>, and then, quick
in a French railway carriage will you find yourself:
a bottle of wine is at your side; the <i>Echo
de Paris</i> lies spread on the seat before you; out
of the window long lines of poplars go marching
with you toward Paris, whither you are
bound "to make the feast."</p>

<p>Grim and gruesome, it may be, are some of
the memories evoked: ill-considered excursions
to the bar of the English railway station, hasty
lunches in chance bun shops, foolish testings of
"ham and beef" limitations. But, henceforth,
take heed to chasten your experience with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
sandwich, that remembrance may not play you
such scurvy tricks. Treat it aright with understanding
and respect, and it will keep you in
glad holiday humour, in the eating thereof as
in the memory.</p>

<p>Life, alas! is not all play in Thames sunshine
and keen Alpine air, or in hopeful journeying
through the pleasant land of France.
But in the everyday of stern work and doleful
dissipation the sandwich is an ally of infallible
trustworthiness and infinite resources. In
the hour of need it is never found wanting.
To dine well, authorities have proclaimed in
<i>ex cathedrâ</i> utterance, you must lunch lightly;
but not, therefore, does it follow that the light
luncheon should be repellently prosaic. Let it
be dainty&mdash;a graceful lyric&mdash;that it may fill you
with hope of the coming dinner. And lyrical
indeed is the savoury sandwich, well cut and
garnished, served on rare faïence or old silver;
a glass, or perhaps two, of Bordeaux of
some famous vintage, to strengthen its subtle
flavour.</p>

<p>An ally again at afternoon tea it proves, if at
five o'clock drink tea you must; a mistake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
surely, if you value your dinner. To belittle
the excellence of crumpets and muffins well
toasted, would be to betray a narrow mind and
senseless prejudice; but these buttery, greasy
delicacies in private should be eaten, where
the ladies of Cranford sucked their oranges.
And at the best their excellence is homely.
In the sandwich well devised is something
exotic and strange, some charm elusive and
mysterious.</p>

<p>But let not the sandwich be of ham, except
rarely, for the etherealized luncheon, the mystic
tea. Reserve this well-meaning, but unpoetic,
viand for the journey and the day of
open-air sport, to which so admirably it is
fitted. Nor so reserving it, will you be hampered
in making what Dumas calls <i>tartines à
l'Anglaise</i>. Infinity is at your disposal, if you
be large and liberal enough to grasp the fact.
One hundred numbered the varieties known to
that genius of Glasgow, who, for his researches,
has been honoured by a place in dictionary and
Encyclopædia. To these you may add, if time
and leisure you find for a trip to Budapest and
the famous Kügler's, where, with your tea, will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
be served such exquisite sandwiches, so original
and many in their devices that you can but
come away marvelling, in all eagerness to emulate
the artist who designed them.</p>

<p>For the luncheon sandwich, choose from the
countless treasures of the sea. Rapture is in
the sardine, not the oiled from France, but the
smoked from Norway; tunny fish or anchovies
are dreams of delight; <i>caviar</i>, an ecstacy, the
more delicious if a dash of lemon juice be
added. And, if you would know these in perfection,
use brown bread instead of white.
Salmon is not to be scorned, nor turbot to be
turned from in contempt; they become triumphs
if you are not too niggardly with cayenne
pepper; triumphs not unknown to Cheapside.
Nor are the various so-called creams&mdash;of
shrimps, of lobster, of salmon&mdash;altogether to
be despised, and they, too, the better prove for
the judicious touch of cayenne. But confine not
your experiments to the conventional or the
recommended. Overhaul the counter of the
fishmonger. Set your wits to work. Cultivate
your artistic instincts. Invent! Create! Many
are the men who have painted pictures: few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
those who have composed a new and perfect
sandwich.</p>

<p>Upon the egg, likewise, you may rely for inspiration&mdash;the
humble hen's egg, or the lordly
plover's. Hard-boiled, in thin slices (oh! the
memories of Kügler's, and the Russian railway
station, and the <i>hor d'&oelig;uvres</i>, Tartar-guarded
sideboard, now awakened!) or well grated; by
itself, or in endless combinations, the egg will
ever repay your confidence.</p>

<p>Upon sausage, also, you may count with loving
faith. <i>Butterbrod mit Wurst</i>&mdash;<i>Wurst</i> and
philosophy, these are the German masterpieces.
And here, you may visit the <i>delicatessen</i> shop to
good purpose. Goose-liver, Brunswick, garlic,
Bologna, truffled&mdash;all fulfil their highest destiny,
when in thinnest of thin slices, you lay
them between slices no less thin of buttered
bread&mdash;brown or white, as artistic appropriateness
suggests&mdash;a faint suspicion of mustard to
lend them piquancy.</p>

<p>Beef and mutton, when not cut in Alpine
chunks, are comforting, and with mustard duly
applied, grateful as well. Fowl and game,
galantine and tongue, veal and brawn&mdash;no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
meat there is, whether fresh or boned or potted,
that does not adapt itself gracefully to certain
occasions, to certain needs. And here, again,
be not slow to arrange new harmonies, to suggest
new schemes. It should be your endeavor
always to give style and individuality to your
sandwiches.</p>

<p>Cheese in shavings, or grated, has great merit.
Greater still has the cool cucumber, fragrant
from its garden ground, the unrivalled tomato,
the crisp, sharp mustard and cress. Scarce a
green thing growing that will not lend itself to
the true artist in sandwich-making. Lettuce,
celery, watercress, radishes&mdash;not one may you
not test to your own higher happiness. And
your art may be measured by your success in
proving the onion to be the poetic soul of the
sandwich, as of the salad bowl. For afternoon
tea the dainty green sandwich is the daintiest
of them all.</p>

<p>If to sweets your taste incline, then easily
may you be gratified, though it be a taste
smacking of the nursery and the schoolroom.
Jams and marmalades you may press into service;
chocolate or candied fruit. And sponge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
cake may take the place of bread, and, with
strawberries between, you have the American
strawberry short-cake.</p>

<p>But, whatever your sandwich, above all
things see that its proportions be delicate and
symmetrical; that it please the eye before ever
the first fragment has passed into the mouth.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">A PERFECT DINNER</h2>

<p>Fashion and art have little in common. Save
for chance, they would remain always as the
poles apart. The laws of the one are transitory,
of the other eternal; and as irreconcilable are
they in the observance. Make then your choice
between them, since no man may serve two
masters.</p>

<p>Know that if ever the noble art of cookery
be wrecked, it will be upon the quicksands of
Fashion. In many ways is it threatened by
the passing mode, but, above all others, one
danger looms up before it, grim, relentless,
tragic: the more awful because, to the thoughtless,
at first it seems sweet as siren's singing.
It is an evil born of the love of display and of
the keen competition between Fashion's votaries.
For they who would pose as delicate
diners, think to eclipse their rivals by number
of courses and bewildering variety. How to
prolong the <i>menu</i>, rather than how to perfect it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
is their constant study. In excess they would
emulate the banquets of the ancients, though
they are too refined by far to revive the old
vomitories&mdash;the indispensable antidote. Dish
follows dish, conceit is piled upon conceit; and
with what result? Before dinner is half over,
palates are jaded, "fine shades" can no more be
appreciated, every new course awakens fear of
the morrow's indigestion. Or else, pleasure is
tempered by caution, a melancholy compromise;
nothing is really eaten, the daintiest
devices are but trifled with, and dinner is degraded
into a torture fit for Tantalus. Surely,
never was there a more cruel, fickle mistress
than Fashion! Sad, immeasurably sad, the fate
of her worshippers.</p>

<p>Art despises show, it disdains rivalry, and it
knows not excess. A Velasquez or a Whistler
never overloads his canvas for the sake of gorgeous
detail. To the artist in words, superfluous
ornament is the unpardonable sin. And so
with the lovers of Gasterea, the tenth and fairest
of the Muses. Better by far Omar Khayyam's
jug of wine and loaf of bread, if both be good,
than all the ill-regulated banquets of a Lucullus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Who would hesitate between the feasts of
Heliogabalus and the frugal fowl and the young
kid, the raisins, figs, and nuts of Horace?</p>

<p>It matters not how many courses between
oysters and coffee Fashion may decree, if, turning
your back upon her and her silly pretensions,
you devise a few that it will be a privilege
for your guests to eat, a joy for them to
remember. Bear in mind the master's model
luncheon and its success. No <i>menu</i> could have
been simpler; none more delicious. The table
was laid for three, a goodly number, for all the
slurs cast upon it. At each plate were "two
dozen oysters with a bright golden lemon; at
each end of the table stood a bottle of Sauterne,
carefully wiped all except the cork, which
showed unmistakably that it was long since the
wine had been bottled." After the oysters
roasted kidneys were served; next, truffled <i>foie-gras</i>;
then the famous <i>fondue</i>, the beautiful
arrangement of eggs beaten up with cheese,
prepared over a chafing-dish at table, stimulating
appetite by all the delights of anticipation.
Fruit followed, and coffee; and last, two
liqueurs, "one a spirit, to clear, and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
an oil, to soothe." Be not content to read,
but go and do likewise!</p>

<p>Imagine a dinner planned on the same pattern,
and the conventional banquet of the day
soon will seem to you the monstrosity it is.
Observe two all-important rules and you may
not wander far wrong. One is to limit the
number of courses; the other to serve first the
substantial dishes, then those that are lighter,
first the simpler wines, afterwards those of finer
flavours.</p>

<p>The <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i>, however, is an exception.
If too substantial it would defeat its end. It
must whet the appetite, not blunt it. In its
flavour must its strength lie; at once keen and
subtle, it should stimulate, but never satisfy.
An anchovy salad touches perfection; the anchovies&mdash;the
boneless species from France&mdash;the
olives skilfully stoned, the capers in carefully
studied proportions, the yellow of the egg well
grated, the parsley, chopped fine, must be arranged
by an artist with a fine feeling for decorative
effect, and the dressing of oil, vinegar,
pepper, and salt, poured gently over the design
so as not to destroy the poetry of line and colour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
A crisp Vienna roll, with sweet fresh
butter, makes an excellent accompaniment, but
one to be enjoyed in moderation.</p>

<p><i>Crème Soubise</i> is the soup to follow. Thick,
creamy, onion-scented, the first spoonful enchants,
and a glamour is at once cast over
dinner and diners. Sufficing in itself, it needs
neither Parmesan nor toast to enhance its merits.
Like a beautiful woman, unadorned it is
adorned the most.</p>

<p>Admirably, it prepares the way for oysters,
deftly scalloped, with shallots and fragrant
<i>bouquet garni</i> to lend them savour, and bread
crumbs to form a rich golden-brown outer
covering. If not unmindful of the eye's pleasure,
you will make as many shells as there are
guests serve the purpose of a single dish.</p>

<p>Without loitering or dallying with useless
<i>entrées</i>, come at once to the one substantial
course of the pleasant feast&mdash;and see that it be
not too substantial. Avoid the heavy, clumsy,
unimaginative joint. Decide rather for idyllic,
<i>Tournedos aux Champignons</i>; the fillet tender and
<i>saignant</i>, as the French say, the mushrooms, not
of the little button variety, suggesting tins or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
bottles, but large and black and fresh from the
market. Rapture is their inevitable sauce:
rapture too deep for words. To share the same
plate <i>pommes soufflées</i> may be found worthy.</p>

<p>None but the irreverent would seek to blur
their impressions by eating other meats after
so delectable a dish. Order, rather, a vegetable
salad, fresh and soothing: potatoes, cauliflower,
carrots, celery, a suspicion of garlic,
and a sprinkling of parsley. Eat slowly; foolish
is the impatient man who gallops through
his pleasures in hot haste.</p>

<p>And now, be bold, defy convention, and do
away with sweets. After so tender a poem,
who could rejoice in the prose of pudding?
But "a last course at dinner, wanting cheese,
is like a pretty woman with only one eye."
Therefore, unless you be blind to beauty, let
cheese be served. Port Salut will do as well
as another; neither too strong nor too mild, it
has qualities not to be prized lightly.</p>

<p>Fruit is the sweet <i>envoy</i> to the Ballade of Dinner.
And of all winter's fruits, the fragrant,
spicy little Tangerine orange is most delicious
and suggestive. Its perfume alone, to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
who have dined discreetly, is a magic pass to
the happy land of dreams. Conversation rallies,
wit flashes, confidences are begotten over
walnuts and almonds, and so, unless in surly,
taciturn mood&mdash;as who could be after so exquisite
a dinner?&mdash;let these have a place upon
your <i>menu</i>.</p>

<p>See that your wines are as perfect of their
kind as your courses. Too many would be a
dire mistake. A good Sauterne, a light Burgundy
will answer well if "of the first quality."
Cheap, or of a poor vintage, they will ruin the
choicest dish.</p>

<p>Upon coffee, too, much depends. It must be
strong, it must be rich, it must be hot. But
strength and richness may not be had unless it
be fresh roasted and ground. Worse a hundredfold
you may do than to mix Mocha with Mysore;
theirs is one of the few happy unions. If
romance have charm for you, then finish with a
little glass of green Chartreuse&mdash;the yellow is
for the feeble and the namby-pamby; powerful,
indeed, is the spell it works, powerful and
ecstatic.</p>

<p>And having thus well and wisely dined, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
cares of life will slip from you; its vexations
and annoyances will dwindle into nothingness.
Serene, at peace with yourself and all mankind,
you may then claim as your right the true joys
of living.</p>

<h2 class="p4">AN AUTUMN DINNER</h2>

<p>Why sigh if summer be done, and already
grey skies, like a pall, hang over fog-choked
London town? The sun may shine, wild winds
may blow, but every evening brings with it the
happy dinner hour. With the autumn days
foolish men play at being pessimists, and talk
in platitudes of the cruel fall of the leaf and
death of love. And what matter? May they
not still eat and drink? May they not still
know that most supreme of all joys, the perfect
dish perfectly served? Small indeed is the evil
of a broken heart compared to a coarsened palate
or disordered digestion.</p>

<p>"Therefore have we cause to be merry!&mdash;and
to cast away all care." Autumn has less to
distract from the pleasure that never fails.
The glare of foolish sunlight no longer lures to
outdoor debauches, the soft breath of the south
wind no longer breathes hope of happiness in
Arcadian simplicity. We can sit in peace by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
our fireside, and dream dreams of a long succession
of triumphant <i>menus</i>. The touch of
frost in the air is as a spur to the artist's invention;
it quickens ambition, and stirs to loftier
aspiration. The summer languor is dissipated,
and with the re-birth of activity is re-awakened
desire for the delicious, the <i>piquante</i>, the fantastic.</p>

<p>Let an autumn dinner then be created!
dainty, as all art must be, with that elegance
and distinction and individuality without which
the masterpiece is not. Strike the personal
note; forswear commonplace.</p>

<p>The glorious, unexpected overture shall be
<i>soupe aux moules</i>. For this great advantage it
can boast: it holds the attention not only in the
short&mdash;all too short&mdash;moment of eating, but
from early in the morning of the eventful day;
nor does it allow itself to be forgotten as the
eager hours race on. At eleven&mdash;and the heart
leaps for delight as the clock strikes&mdash;the <i>pot-au-feu</i>
is placed upon the fire; at four, tomatoes
and onions&mdash;the onions white as the driven
snow&mdash;communing in all good fellowship in
a worthy saucepan follow; and at five, after an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
hour's boiling, they are strained through a
sieve, peppered, salted, and seasoned. And
now is the time for the mussels, swimming in
a sauce made of a bottle of white wine, a <i>bouquet-garni</i>,
carrot, excellent vinegar, and a glass
of ordinary red wine, to be offered up in their
turn, and some thirty minutes will suffice for
the ceremony. At this critical point, bouillon,
tomatoes, and mussels meet in a proper pot
well rubbed with garlic, and an ardent quarter
of an hour will consummate the union. As
you eat, something of the ardour becomes
yours, and in an ecstasy the dinner begins.</p>

<p>Sad indeed would it prove were imagination
exhausted with so promising a prelude. Each
succeeding course must lead to new ecstasy,
else will the dinner turn out the worst of failures.
In <i>turbot au gratin</i>, the ecstatic possibilities
are by no means limited. In a chaste
silver dish, make a pretty wall of potatoes,
which have been beaten to flour, enlivened
with pepper and salt, enriched with butter and
cream&mdash;cream thick and fresh and altogether
adorable&mdash;seasoned with Parmesan cheese, and
left on the stove for ten minutes, neither more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
nor less; let the wall enclose layers of turbot,
already cooked and in pieces, of melted butter
and of cream, with a fair covering of bread-crumbs;
and rely upon a quick oven to complete
the masterpiece.</p>

<p>After so pretty a conceit, where would be
the poetry in heavy joints or solid meats? <i>Ris
de veau aux truffes</i> surely would be more in sympathy;
the sweetbreads baked and browned
very tenderly, the sauce fashioned of truffles
duly sliced, marsala, lemon juice, salt and
<i>paprika</i>, with a fair foundation of benevolent
bouillon. And with so exquisite a dish no disturbing
vegetable should be served.</p>

<p>And after? If you still hanker for the roast
beef and horseradish of Old England, then go
and gorge yourself at the first convenient restaurant.
Would you interrupt a symphony that
the orchestra might play "God save the Queen"?
Would you set the chorus in "Atalanta in Calydon"
to singing odes by Mr Alfred Austen?
There is a place for all things, and the place
for roast beef is not on the ecstatic <i>menu</i>.
Grouse, rather, would meet the diner's mood&mdash;grouse
with memories of the broad moor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
purple heather. Roast them at a clear fire,
basting them with maternal care. Remember
that they, as well as pheasants and partridges,
should "have gravy in the dish and bread-sauce
in a cup." Their true affinity is less the vegetable,
however artistically prepared, than the
salad, serenely simple, that discord may not be
risked. Not this the time for the bewildering
<i>macédoine</i>, or the brilliant tomato. Choose, instead,
lettuce; crisp cool <i>Romaine</i> by choice.
Sober restraint should dignify the dressing; a
suspicion of chives may be allowed; a sprinkling
of well-chopped tarragon leaves is indispensable.
Words are weak to express, but the
true poet strong to feel the loveliness now fast
reaching its climax.</p>

<p>It is autumn, the mood is fantastic: a sweet,
if it tend not to the vulgarity of heavy puddings
and stodgy pies, will introduce an amusing, a
sprightly element. <i>Omelette soufflée</i> claims the
privilege. But it must be light as air, all but
ethereal in substance, a mere nothing to melt
in the mouth like a beautiful dream. And yet
in melting it must yield a flavour as soft as the
fragrance of flowers, and as evanescent. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
sensation must be but a passing one that piques
the curiosity and soothes the excited palate.
A dash of orange-flower water, redolent of the
graceful days that are no more, another of wine
from Andalusian vineyards, and the sensation
may be secured.</p>

<p>By the law of contrasts the vague must give
way to the decided. The stirring, glorious
climax after the brief, gentle interlude, will be
had in <i>canapé des olives farcies</i>, the olives stuffed
with anchovies and capers, deluged with cayenne,
prone on their beds of toast and girded
about with astonished watercress.</p>

<p>Fruit will seem a graceful afterthought;
pears all golden, save where the sun, a passionate
lover, with his kisses set them to blushing
a rosy red; grapes, purple and white and voluptuous;
figs, overflowing with the exotic
sweetness of their far southern home; peaches,
tender and juicy and desirable. To eat is to
eschew all prose, to spread the wings of the
soul in glad poetic flight. What matter, indeed,
if the curtains shut out stormy night or
monstrous fog?</p>

<p>Rejoice that no blue ribbon dangles unnecessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and ignominiously at your buttonhole.
Wine, rich wine to sing in the glass with
"odorous music," the autumn dinner demands.
Burgundy, rich red Burgundy, it should be;
Beaune or Pomard as you will, to fire the blood
and set the fancy free. And let none other but
yourself warm it; study its temperature as the
lover might study the frowns and smiles of his
beloved. And the "Spirit of Wine" will sing
in your hearts that you too may triumph</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">In the savour and scent of his music,</div>
<div class="line">His magnetic and mastering song.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the Burgundy will make superfluous Port
and Tokay, and all the dessert wines, sweet or
dry, which unsympathetic diners range before
them upon the coming of the fruit.</p>

<p>Drink nothing else until wineglass be pushed
aside for cup of coffee, black and sweet of savour,
a blend of Mocha and Mysore. Rich,
thick, luxurious, Turkish coffee would be a
most fitting epilogue. But then, see that you
refuse the more frivolous, feminine liqueurs.
Cognac, old and strong-hearted, alone would
meet the hour's emotions&mdash;Cognac, the gift of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the gods, the immortal liquid. Lean back and
smoke in silence, unless speech, exchanged
with the one kind spirit, may be golden and
perfect as the dinner.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">A MIDSUMMER DINNER</h2>

<p>At midsummer, the <i>gourmand</i> subsists chiefly
on hope of the good time coming. The 12th
ushers in season of glorious plenty. But, for
the moment, there is a lull in the market's
activity. Green things there are in abundance;
but upon green things alone it is not
good for man to live. Consult the oracle; turn
to the immortal, infallible "Almanack," and
confirmation of this sad truth will stare you in
the face plainly, relentlessly. Sucking-pig is
sole consolation offered by benevolent De la
Reynière to well-nigh inconsolable man. But
what a poem in the sucking-pig that gambols
gaily over his pages: a delicious roasted creature,
its little belly stuffed full of liver and
truffles and mushrooms, capers, anchovies,
aromatic pepper, and salt, all wrought together
into one elegant <i>farce</i>; while in dish apart, as
indispensable acolyte, an orange sauce waits to
complete the masterpiece! <i>En daube</i>, this amiable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
little beast is not to be despised, nor <i>en
ragoût</i> need it be dismissed with disdain, though,
let man of letters beware! The Society of Authors,
with his welfare at heart, should warn
him while still there is time. What zest might
be given to the savourless <i>Author</i>, their organ,
were its columns well filled with stately and
brilliant discourses upon food and good eating.
How the writer of delicate perceptions should
eat: is that not, as subject, prettier and more
profitable far than how much money he can
make by publishing here and lecturing there?</p>

<p>The poor <i>gourmand</i>, in sorry plight during
midsummer's famine, may seek blessed light
also from Filippini, Delmonico's cook. Out of
the fulness of his heart he speaketh, leaving
not one of August's thirty-one shortening days
without elaborate <i>menu</i>. But London must fast
while New York feasts. At Delmonico's, happy
diners may smile gracious welcome to Lima
beans and sweet corn, to succotash and egg-plant,
to chicken <i>à l'okra</i> and clam chowder,
but what hope for the patrons of Verrey's and
Nichol's? What hope, unless, forthwith, they
emigrate to that promised land beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
broad Atlantic? For the rest, Filippini reveals
not the originality, the invention that one
would have hoped from him, even at the season
when men are struck dead by the sun in the
streets of his dear town of adoption. Roast
turkey, with cranberry sauce, is suggestive of
November's drear days; Brussels sprouts sum
up greengrocers' resources in midwinter. But
why falter? Hope need never be abandoned
by the wise, whose faith is strong in himself.</p>

<p>The season presents difficulties, but the beautiful
dinner may still be designed. To meet
August's flaming mood, it should be rich, and
frankly voluptuous. Let flowers that bespeak
autumn's approach and the fulness of harvest
give the dinner its keynote. In Delft bowl, of
appropriate coarseness, heap the late summer's
first dahlias, all scarlet and gold as London's
sunset at the fall of the year. To the earth's
ripeness and fertility their bold, unabashed
hues bear loud and triumphant witness.</p>

<p>Let the soup be at once tribute and farewell
to spring that has gone. Regret will be luxuriously
expressed in <i>purée de petits pois</i>; spinach
added to the fresh peas to lend flavour and colour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
a dash of sugar for sweetness' sake, a pinch
of <i>paprika</i> to counteract it, a suspicion of onion
to strengthen it. Arrowroot, in discreet measure,
will answer for thickening, and impart
more becoming consistency even than flour.
Pleasure in the eating will be tempered by sorrow
in the prospect of parting, and therefore
intensified a hundredfold. Where the joy in
possession but for the ever-present fear of loss?</p>

<p>With the second course, banish regret. Forget
yesterday; be indifferent to to-morrow;
revel riotously in to-day. <i>Hure de saumon à la
Cambacérès</i> will point out the way to supreme
surrender. Close to the head, the delicate
silver-rose of the fish must be cut in lavish proportions;
braised gently, its removal to the
dish that is waiting is signal to surround it
with truffles and mushrooms and stoned olives&mdash;garland
beyond compare; a sauce of drawn
butter, seasoned with <i>paprika</i> and lemon juice
and parsley, is essential accompaniment. And
now the present truly has conquered!</p>

<p>The third course must not betray the second's
promise. Gay and fantastic, it must be
well able to stand the dread test of comparison.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
<i>Rognons d'agneau à l'éþicurienne</i> enters nobly into
the breach; the lamb's dainty kidneys are split
and grilled with decorum, their fragrant centres
are adorned with sympathetic <i>sauce Tartare</i>,
golden potatoes <i>à la Parisienne</i> insist upon serving
as garniture, and Mr Senn demands, as
finishing touch, the stimulating seduction of
<i>sauce Poivrade</i>. Who now will say that August
is barren of delicious devices?</p>

<p>To follow: <i>poulet sauté à l'Hongroise</i>, the clash
of the Czardas captured and imprisoned in a
stew-pan. With the Racoczy's wild drumming
stirring memory into frenzy, stew the fowl,
already cut into six willing pieces, with butter,
a well-minced onion, pepper&mdash;<i>paprika</i> by choice&mdash;and
salt; ten minutes will suffice&mdash;how, indeed,
endure the strain a second longer? Then
to the notes of the cymbal, moisten with <i>Béchamel</i>
sauce and fair quantity of cream, and rejoice
in the fine Romany rapture for just twenty
minutes more. Decorate with <i>croûtons</i>, and send
fancy, without fetters, wandering across the
plains and over the mountains of song-bound
Magyarland. To play the gypsy, free as the
deer in the forest, as the bird in the air, is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
this as it should be in the month, more than
all others, pledged to <i>pleinairisme</i>? Insipid, as
life without love, is the dinner without imagination.</p>

<p>Vegetables have no special place in the
scheme of August's dinner. But a salad will
not come amiss. Remember, the feast is ordered
in sheer voluptuousness of spirit. The
fifth course calls for the scarlet splendour of
tomatoes; and the presiding dahlias, in bowl
of Delft, clamour for the gold of <i>mayonnaise</i>
sauce to carry out the exulting trumpeting
harmony. A hint, here, to the earnest, ambitious
<i>gourmand</i>; if cream be worked, deftly
and slowly, into the thickening sauce, sublime
will be the results.</p>

<p>A sweet, at this juncture, would err if over-chaste
in conception. Picture to yourself the
absurd figure cut by tapioca pudding or apple
dumpling on conscientiously voluptuous <i>menu</i>?
A <i>macédoine méringuée</i> would have more legitimate
claim to close the banquet with distinction.
August supplies fruit without stint:
plums and greengages and apricots and nectarines
and peaches and pears and grapes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
bananas; all join together to sweet purpose,
with ecstatic intent; a large wineglass of
Claret, a generous sprinkling of Cognac will
guard against puerility. The protecting <i>méringue</i>
should be crisp and pale golden brown;
and later it will need the reinforcement of thick
luscious cream.</p>

<p>A sweet fails to delight, unless a savoury
comes speedily after. <i>Caviar de Russie en crêpes</i>
is worthy successor of <i>macédoine méringue</i>.
Mingle cream with the <i>caviar</i>, and none who
eats will have cause to complain. It reconciles
to the barbarous, even where Tolstoi and Marie
Bashkirtseff may have failed.</p>

<p>To dally with fruit is graceful excuse to linger
longer over wine. Plums and greengages,
their bloom still fresh, their plump roundness
never yet submitted to trial by fire, figs&mdash;pale
northern ghosts, alas!&mdash;peaches, grapes, make
exquisite interlude&mdash;between dinner and coffee.
Refrain not: abstinence, of all follies created
by man, is the most wicked, the most unpardonable.</p>

<p>Drink Chambertin, that the song in your
heart may be fervent and firm. Drink, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
your courage may be strong for the feasting.
Shake off the shackles of timidity. Be fearless
and brave, turning a deaf ear to the temptations
of the temperate. To be moderate at midsummer
is to disregard the imperative commands
of immoderate nature.</p>

<p>Coffee, made as the Turks make it, will bring
languorous, irresistible message from the sensuous
East. <i>Fine Champagne</i> will add the energy
of the fiery West. Adorable combination!
Oh, East is East, and West is West; but the
twain the day of the August dinner shall meet.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">TWO SUPPERS</h2>

<p>Tradition is a kindly tyrant. Why then strive
to shake off its shackles? To bow the neck
gladly beneath the yoke is at times to win rich
reward, first in charm of association, and then
in pleasantness of actual fact.</p>

<p>Is there not a tradition in England that supper
is more appropriate to the quiet of Sunday
evenings than dinner? No use to ask whence
it arose or whither it leads. There it is, though
many would evade it as senseless makeshift.
To forswear dinner for all time and eternity
would be worse than folly; it is life's most solemn,
most joyous ceremony. But once and
again, for dear sake of contrast, to find a seducing
substitute is wisdom in a world where all
pleasures fail, and man is constant to one
thing never. And now that summer has come
and holds the green earth in its ardent embrace,
now that days are long, and sweetest hours are
those when the sun sinks low, there is new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
delight in the evening meal that leaves one
free to dream in the twilight, that does not
summon one indoors just as all outdoors is
loveliest. Supper on every day in the week
would be a mistake; but on one in seven it
may well be commended, especially when the
month is June. In the afternoon, tea is served
in the garden, or whatever London can offer in
the garden's stead. There are a few strawberries
in a pretty old porcelain dish to lend an
air of dainty substance, and there is rich cream
in which they may hide their pretty blushes;
and there is gay talk and happy silence. Indolent
hours follow. Is it not Sunday, and are
not all weekly cares pigeon-holed out of sight?</p>

<p>Nor do the advantages of the occasional supper
end here. It is excellent excuse for the
ice-cold banquet which in the warm summer-time
has its own immeasurable virtues. A
supper should be cold; else it deteriorates into
mere sham dinner. Never do cold dishes seem
more delicious than when cruel thermometer is
at fever heat. You see? There is logic in the
Sunday evening supper, at this season of all
seasons for love, and eating, and drinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
But supper does not mean, necessarily, veal
and ham pie, above which British imagination
dares not soar. It is not limited to the half-demolished
joint&mdash;sad wreck of midday's meal.
It may be as fair and harmonious as dinner
itself, as noble a tribute to the artist, as superb
a creation. Only the thoughtless and prosaic
will dismiss it carelessly in the ordering, believing
that any odds and ends will answer.
Whatever is left over is to many the one possible
conception of the late evening meal. But
the <i>gourmand</i>, exulting in his gluttony, makes
of it a work of art, good in the eating, good in
the remembrance thereof.</p>

<p>Summer allows wide scope for his fertile
fancy. He may begin with salmon, refreshing
to the eye in its arrangement of pale silver and
rose, cold as the glaciers of Greenland after its
long hours of repose on voluptuous bed of ice.
A <i>mayonnaise</i> sauce, creamy and rich, turning
the silver to gold, like a fairy godmother of
legend, is the cherished accompaniment. The
feeling of wonder, aroused in the hours of
watching under the trees, being still upper-most,
it will seem as if the soft hues of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
afterglow had been embodied in this exquisite
prologue, with its rose and citron, its gold and
soft grey tints.</p>

<p>Tender spring chickens may then give greeting
to the summer-time. They also will have
spent hours in close communion with solid
blocks of ice, and will be as cool as the breezes
that blow over the high snow fields of Switzerland.
For, be it noted in passing, without a
refrigerator the perfect supper is sheer impossibility.
Success depends largely upon temperature.
Lukewarm supper would be as
detestable as a lukewarm dinner. With the
innocent chickens, chilling and chaste, a green
salad will be as appropriate as edelweiss on
Alpine slopes. It should be made of the hearts
of the youngest of young cabbage lettuces,
touched with onions, and fatigued with the one
most admirable salad dressing that man ever
devised. Linger as long as may be, for this
surely is one of the beautiful moments that repay
the artist for his toiling and his intervals
of despair.</p>

<p>Asparagus will prove most seemly successor.
Let it also be cold beyond suspicion. A sauce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of vinegar and oil, pepper and salt, force it to
yield its most subtle sweetness. It will prove
another course to call for lingering. Unless
happiness be realised, of what use is it to be
happy? He who is not conscious of pleasure
when he eats is not worthy to sit at table with
the elect. Like the animals, he is content to
feed, and the art of the cook is, alas! lost upon
him.</p>

<p>A savoury at this banquet would be superfluous.
The presence of cheese would be but
deference to convention, and faithfulness to
tradition does not demand as its price sacrifice
of all freedom in detail. The asparagus would
be dishonoured were it to give place to aught
more substantial than strawberries. Sometimes
in the day's <i>menu</i>, as in a decorative
scheme, loveliness is enhanced by repetition.
As a second curve emphasises the grace of the
first, so strawberries at supper carry out with
great elegance the strawberry scheme of afternoon
tea. Pretty hillocks of sugar, and deep
pools of cream, make a rich setting for this
jewel among fruits.</p>

<p>The wine, clearly, should be white, and it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
too, should be iced&mdash;remember the month is
June. Few Rhine wines could consistently refuse
to be pressed into service. But French
vineyards have greater charm than German,
though the Lorelei may sing in near waters,
and to Graves, or Barsac, preference will be
wisely proffered.</p>

<p>Be fearful of striking a false note. See that
the coffee, black and strong though it be, is as
cold as wine and salmon, chicken and salad.
And pour the green Chartreuse into glasses
that have been first filled with crushed ice.
And as you smoke your cigarette, ask yourself
if the Sunday evening supper tradition be not
one crying for preservation at all costs.</p>

<p>When another week has rolled by and disappeared
into the <i>Ewigkeit</i>, vary the <i>menu</i>. An
element of the <i>bizarre</i>, the strange, the unaccustomed,
often lends irresistible piquancy.
Be faithful to the refrigerator, however fickle
to other loves. Open the banquet with a stirring
salad fashioned of red herring and potatoes,
and, perhaps, a few leaves of lettuce. It
savours of the sensational, and stimulates
appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
That disappointment may not ensue, desert
well-trodden paths, and, borrowing from Germany,
serve a dish of meat, amusing in its
quaint variety. Slices of lamb may provide a
pretty centre, surrounding them, scatter slices
of the sausage of Brunswick and Bologna, here
and there set in relief against a piece of grey
<i>Leberwurst</i>. As garniture, encircle the dish
with a garland of anchovies, curled up into enchanting
little balls, and gherkins, and hard-boiled
eggs cut in delicate rounds. Memories
will crowd fast upon you as you eat; memories
of the little German towns and their forgotten
hilltops, visited in summers long since gone, of
the little German inn, and the friendly land-lord,
eager to please; of the foaming mugs of
beer, and the tall, slender goblets of white
wine. Before supper is done, you will have
travelled leagues upon leagues into the playtime
of the past.</p>

<p>Cheese now is as essential as it would have
been intrusive in the other <i>menu</i>. Gruyère
should be your choice, and if you would have
it of fine flavour, seek it not at the English
cheesemonger's, but at the little German <i>delicatessen</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
shop. Brown bread would best enter into
the spirit of the feast.</p>

<p>As epilogue, fruit can never be discordant,
and what fruit in early June insists upon being
eaten with such sweet persistency as the strawberry.
But, on your German evening, fatigue
it with Kirsch, leave it on its icy couch until
the very last minute, and memories of the
Lapérouse will mingle with those of the smoky
inn of the Fatherland.</p>

<p>Is there any question that Hock is the wine,
when sausage and red herring and Gruyère
cheese figure so prominently in the <i>menu's</i> composition?
Drink it from tall slender glass, that
it may take you fully into its confidence.
Coffee need not be iced. In fact, it should
positively be hot&mdash;can you doubt it? And Cognac
now will prove more responsive to your
mood than Chartreuse. There is no written
law to regulate these matters. But the true
artist needs no code to guide him. He knows
instinctively what is right and what is wrong,
and doubts can never assail him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">ON SOUP</h2>

<p>"When all around the wind doth blow," draw
close the curtains, build up a roaring fire,
light lamp and candles, and begin your dinner
with a good&mdash;<i>good</i>, mind you&mdash;dish of soup.
Words of wisdom are these, to be pondered
over by the woman who would make her evening
dinner a joyful anticipation, a cherished
memory.</p>

<p>Soup, with so much else good and great, is
misunderstood in an England merrier than
dainty in her feasting. Better is this matter
ordered across the Border. For the healthy-minded,
Scotch mists have their compensation
in Scotch broth; odoriferous and appetising is
its very name. But in England, soup long
since became synonymous with turtle, and the
guzzling alderman of legend. Richness is
held its one essential quality&mdash;richness, not
strength. Too often, a thick, greasy mess,
that could appeal but to the coarsest hunger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
will be set before you, instead of the dish that
can be comforting and sustaining both, and yet
meddles not with the appetite. It should be
but a prelude to the meal&mdash;the prologue, as it
were, to the play&mdash;its excellence, a welcome
forecast of delights to follow, a welcome stimulus
to light talk and lighter laughter. Over
<i>Julienne</i> or <i>bisque</i> frowns are smoothed away,
and guests who sat down to table in monosyllabic
gloom will plunge boldly into epigrammatic
or anecdotic gaiety ere ever the fish be
served.</p>

<p>Magical, indeed, is the spell good soup can
cast. Of its services as medicine or tonic, why
speak? Beef tea gives courage to battle with
pain and suffering; <i>consommé</i> cheers the hours
of convalescence. Let all honour be done to it
for its virtues in the sick-room; but with so
cheerful a subject, it is pleasanter to dwell on
its more cheerful aspects.</p>

<p>More legitimate is it to consider the happy
part it plays in the traveller's programme.
And for this&mdash;it must be repeated, as for all
the best things in the <i>gourmand's</i> life&mdash;one journeys
to France. But first remember&mdash;that contrast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
may add piquancy to the French <i>menu</i>&mdash;the
fare that awaits the weary, disconsolate
traveller at English railway station: the stodgy
bun, Bath and penny varieties both, and the
triangular sandwich; the tea drawn overnight,
and the lukewarm bovril, hopelessly inadequate
substitute for soup freshly made from beef or
stock. At a luncheon bar thus wickedly
equipped, eating becomes what it never should
be!&mdash;a sad, terrible necessity, a pleasureless
safeguard against pangs of hunger, a mere
animal function, and therefore a degradation
to the human being educated to look upon food
and drink&mdash;even so might the painter regard
his colours, the sculptor his clay and marble&mdash;as
means only to a perfect artistic end.</p>

<p>Or, consider also, to make the contrast
stronger, the choicest banquet American railways,
for all the famed American enterprise,
provide. To journey by the "Pullman vestibuled
train" from New York to Chicago is luxury,
if you will. Upon your point of view
depends the exact amount of enjoyment yielded
by meals eaten while you dash through the
world at the rate of eighty miles an hour, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
or less, and generally less. There is charm in
the coloured waiters, each with gay flower in
his buttonhole, and gayer smile on his jolly,
black face; there is pretence in the cheap,
heavy, clumsy Limoges off which you eat, out
of which you drink, in the sham silver case in
which your Champagne bottle is brought, if
for Champagne you are foolish enough to call.
But bitterness is in your wine cup, for the wine
is flat; heaviness is in your breakfast or dinner,
for bread is underdone and sodden, and butter
is bad, and the endless array of little plates
discourages with its suggestion of vulgar plenty
and artless selection; and all is vanity and vexation,
save the corn bread&mdash;the beautiful golden
corn bread, which deserves a chapter to itself&mdash;and
the fruit: the bananas and grapes, and
peaches and oranges, luscious and ravishing as
they seldom are on any but American soil.
Nor will you mend matters by bestowing your
patronage upon the railway restaurants of the
big towns where you stop: the dirty, fly-bitten
lunch counters. Pretentious, gorgeous, magnificent,
they maybe; but good, no! All, even
the privilege of journeying at the rate of eighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
miles an hour, would you give for one bowl of
good soup at the Amiens <i>buffet</i>.</p>

<p>For, when everything is said, it is the soup
which makes travelling so easy and luxurious
in France. A breakfast, or a dinner, of courses,
well-cooked, and well-served into the bargain,
you may eat at many a wayside station. Wine,
ordinary as its name, perhaps, but still good
and honest, is to be had for a paltry sum whenever
the train may stop. Crisp rolls, light
<i>brioches</i> tempt you to unwise excesses. Not a
province, scarce a town, but has its own special
dainty; nougat at Montélimart, sausages at
Arles, <i>pâté de foie gras</i> at Pèrigueux; and so you
might go on mapping out the country according
to, not its departments, but its dishes. These,
however, the experienced traveller would gladly
sacrifice for the delicate, strong, refreshing,
inspiriting <i>bouillon</i>, served at every <i>buffet</i>. This
it is which helps one to forget fatigue and dust
and cinders, and the odious Frenchman who
will have all the windows shut. <i>Bouillon</i>, and
not wine, gives one new heart to face the long
night and the longer miles. With it the day's
journey is well begun and well ended. It sustains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and nourishes; and, better still, it has its
own æsthetic value; perfect in itself, it is the
one perfect dish for the place and purpose. No
wonder, then, that it has kindled even Mr
Henry James into at least a show of enthusiasm;
his bowls of <i>bouillon</i> ever remain in the
reader's memory, the most prominent pleasures
of his "Little Tour in France."</p>

<p>Equally desirable in illness and in health,
during one's journeys abroad and one's days at
home, why is it then that soup has never yet
been praised and glorified as it should? How
is it that its greatness has inspired neither ode
nor epic; that it has been left to a parody&mdash;clever,
to be sure, but cleverness alone is not
tribute sufficient&mdash;in a child's book to sing its
perfections. It should be extolled, and it has
been vilified; insults have been heaped upon it;
ingratitude from man has been its portion.
The soup tureen is as poetic as the loving cup;
why should it suggest but the baldest prose to
its most ardent worshippers?</p>

<p>"Thick or clear?" whispers the restaurant
waiter in your ear, as he points to the soups on
the bill of fare. "Thick or clear,"&mdash;there you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
have the two all-important divisions. In that
simple phrase is expressed the whole science of
soupmaking; face to face with first principles
it brings you. But whether you elect for the
one or the other, this great fundamental truth
there is, ever to be borne in mind: let fresh
meat be the basis of your <i>consommé</i> as of your
<i>bisque</i>, of your <i>gumbo</i> as of your <i>pâtes d'Italie</i>.
True, in an emergency, Liebig, and all its
many offshoots, may serve you&mdash;and serve you
well. But if you be a woman of feeling, of
fancy, of imagination, for this emergency alone
will you reserve your Liebig. Who would eat
tinned pineapple when the fresh fruit is to be
had? Would you give bottled tomatoes preference
when the gay <i>pommes d'amour</i>, just picked,
ornament every stall in the market? Beef extract
in skilful hands may work wonders; the
soup made from it may deceive the connoisseur
of great repute. But what then? Have you
no conscience, no respect for your art, that you
would thus deceive?</p>

<p>Tinned soups also there be in infinite variety,
ox-tail, and mock-turtle, and <i>Julienne</i>, and
gravy, and chicken broth, and many more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
one likes to think of. But dire indeed must be
your need before you have recourse to them.
They, too, will answer in the hour of want.
But at the best, they prove but make-shifts, but
paltry make-believes to be avoided, even as you
steer clear of the soup vegetables and herbs&mdash;bits
of carrot and onion and turnip and who
knows what?&mdash;bottled ingeniously, pretty to the
eye, without flavour to the palate. One does
not eat to please the sense of sight alone!</p>

<p>When, heroically, you have forsworn the ensnaring
tin and the insinuating bottle, the horizon
widens before you. "Thick and clear":
the phrase suggests but narrow compass; broad
beyond measure is the sphere it really opens.</p>

<p>Of all the Doges of Bobbio, but one&mdash;if tradition
be true&mdash;sickened of his hundred soups.
Three hundred and sixty-five might have been
their number with results no more disastrous.
Given a cook of good instincts and gay imagination,
and from one year's end to the other
never need the same soup be served a second
time.</p>

<p>A word, first, as to its proper place on the
<i>menu</i>. The conservative Briton might think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
this a subject upon which the last word long
since had been spoken. If soup at all, then
must it appear between <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i> and fish:
as well for Catholic to question the doctrine of
infallibility as for self-respecting man to doubt
the propriety of this arrangement. But they
don't know everything down in Great Britain,
and other men there be of other minds. Order
a dinner in the American West, and a procession
of smiling, white-robed blacks&mdash;talking,
alas! no more the good old darkey, but pure
American&mdash;swoop down upon you, bringing at
once, in disheartening medley, your blue-points,
your gumbo, your terrapin, your reed birds, and
your apple pie. What sacrilege! In the pleasantest
little restaurant in all Rome, close to
the Piazza Colonna, within sound of the Corso,
was once to be seen any evening in the week&mdash;may
be still, for that matter&mdash;a bemedalled
major finishing his dinner with his <i>minestra</i> instead
of his <i>dolce</i>. But if a fat, little grey-haired
man once consent to wear a coat scarce longer
than an Eton jacket, may not, in reason, worse
enormities be expected of him? Truth to tell,
the British convention, borrowed from France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
is the best. If, in good earnest, you would
profit by your <i>potage</i>, give it place of honour at
the top of the <i>menu</i>. Leave light and frivolous
sweets to lighter, more frivolous moments,
when, hunger appeased, man may unbend to
trifles.</p>

<p>What the great Alexandre calls the <i>grand consommé</i>
is the basis of all soup&mdash;and sauce making.
Study his very word with reverence;
carry out his every suggestion with devotion.
Among the ingredients of this consummate
<i>bouillon</i> his mighty mind runs riot. Not even
the adventures of the immortal Musketeers
stimulated his fancy to wilder flights. His
directions, large and lavish as himself, would
the economical housewife read with awe and
something of terror. Veal and beef and fowl&mdash;a
venerable cock will answer&mdash;and rabbit
and partridges of yester-year; these be no more
than the foundation. Thrown into the <i>marmite</i>
in fair and fitting proportions, then must they
be watched, anxiously and intelligently, as
they boil; spoonfuls of the common <i>bouillon</i>
should be poured upon them from time to time;
there must be added onions and carrots, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
celery and parsley, and whatever aromatic
herbs may be handy, and oil, if you have it;
and after four hours of boiling slowly and demurely
over a gentle fire, and, next, straining
through coarse linen, you may really begin to
prepare your soup.</p>

<p>If to these heights the ordinary man&mdash;or woman&mdash;may
not soar, then will the good, substantial,
everyday <i>bouillon</i>, or <i>pot-au-feu</i>&mdash;made
of beef alone, but ever flavoured with vegetables&mdash;fulfil
the same purpose, not so deliciously,
but still fairly well. In households
where soup is, as it should be, a daily necessity,
stock may be made and kept for convenience.
But if you would have your <i>pot-au-feu</i> in perfection,
let the saucepan, or <i>marmite</i>&mdash;the English
word is commonplace, the French term charms&mdash;be
not of iron, but of earthenware: rich
tawny brown or golden green in colour, as you
see it in many a French market-place, if the
least feeling for artistic fitness dwells within
your soul. Seven hours are needed <i>pour faire
sourire le pot-au-feu</i>&mdash;the expression is not to be
translated. Where soups are concerned the
English language is poor, and cold, and halting;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the speech of France alone can honour
them aright.</p>

<p>With good <i>bouillon</i> there is naught the genius
may not do. Into it the French <i>chef</i> puts a few
small slices of bread, and, as you eat, you wonder
if terrapin or turtle ever tasted better.
With the addition of neatly-chopped carrots
and onions, and turnips and celery, you have
<i>Julienne</i>; or, with dainty asparagus tops, sweet
fresh peas, tiny stinging radishes, delicate
young onions, <i>printanier</i>, with its suggestions of
spring and blossoms in every mouthful. This
last, surely, is the lyric among soups. Decide
upon cheese instead, and you will set a Daudet
singing you a poem in prose: "<i>Oh! la bonne
odeur de soupe au fromage!</i>" <i>Pâtes d'Italie</i>, <i>vermicelli</i>,
<i>macaroni</i>, each will prove a separate ecstasy,
if you but remember the grated Parmesan that
must be sprinkled over it without stint&mdash;as in
Italy. Days there be when nothing seems so
in keeping as rice: others, when cabbage hath
charm, that is, if first in your simmering <i>bouillon</i>
a piece of ham&mdash;whether of York, of Strasbourg,
or of Virginia&mdash;be left for three hours
or more; again, to thicken the golden liquid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
with tapioca may seem of all devices the most
adorable. And so may you ring the changes
day after day, week after week, month after
month.</p>

<p>If of these lighter soups you tire, then turn
with new hope and longing to the stimulating
list of <i>purées</i> and <i>crèmes</i>. Let tomatoes, or peas,
or beans, or lentils, as you will, be the keynote,
always you may count upon a harmony
inspiriting and divine; a rapture tenfold greater
if it be enjoyed in some favourite corner at
Marguery's or Voisin's, where the masterpiece
awaits the chosen few. Or if, when London
fogs are heavy and life proves burdensome,
comfort is in the very name of broth, then put
it to the test in its mutton, Scotch, chicken, or
dozen and more varieties, and may it give you
new courage to face the worst!</p>

<p>But if for pleasure solely you eat your soup,
as you should, unless illness or the blue devils
have you firm in their grasp, a few varieties
there be which to all the rest are even as is the
rose to lesser flowers, as is the onion to vegetables
of more prosaic virtue. Clams are a joy
if you add to them but salt and pepper&mdash;cayenne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
by preference&mdash;and a dash of lemon juice:
as a chowder, they are a substantial dream to
linger over; but made into soup they reach
the very topmost bent of their being: it is the
end for which they were created. Of oysters
this is no less true. Veal stock or mutton broth
may pass as prosaic basis of the delicacy; but
better depend upon milk and cream, and of the
latter be not sparing. Mace, in discreet measure,
left flowing in the liquid will give the
finishing, the indispensable touch. Oh, the
inexhaustible resources of the sea! With these
delights rank <i>bisque</i>, that priceless <i>purée</i>, made
of crayfish&mdash;in this case a pinch of allspice
instead of mace&mdash;and if in its fullest glory you
would know it, go eat it at the Lapérouse on
the Quai des Grands Augustins; eat it, as from
the window of the low room in the <i>entresol</i>, you
look over toward the towers of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>Be a good Catholic on Fridays, that, with
<i>potages maigres</i>&mdash;their name, too, is legion&mdash;your
soups may be increased and multiplied,
and thus infinity become your portion.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">THE SIMPLE SOLE</h2>

<p>Have you ever considered the sole: the simple,
unassuming sole, in Quaker-like garb,
striking a quiet grey note in every fishmonger's
window, a constant rebuke to the mackerel that
makes such vain parade of its green audacity,
of the lobster that flaunts its scarlet boldness
in the face of the passer-by? By its own merits
the sole appeals; upon no meretricious charm
does it base its claim for notice. Flat and elusive,
it seems to seek retirement, to beg to be
forgotten. And yet, year by year, it goes on,
unostentatiously and surely increasing in price;
year by year, it establishes, with firm hold, its
preeminence upon the <i>menu</i> of every well-regulated
<i>table d'hôte</i>.</p>

<p>But here pause a moment, and reflect. For
it is this very <i>table d'hôte</i> which bids fair to be
the sole's undoing. If it has been maligned
and misunderstood, it is because, swaddled in
bread-crumbs, fried in indifferent butter, it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
come to be the symbol of hotel or <i>pension</i> dinner,
until the frivolous and heedless begin to
believe that it cannot exist otherwise, that in
its irrepressible bread-crumbs it must swim
through the silent sea.</p>

<p>The conscientious <i>gourmand</i> knows better,
however. He knows that bread-crumbs and
frying-pan are but mere child's play compared
to its diviner devices. It has been said that
the number and various shapes of fishes are not
"more strange or more fit for contemplation
than their different natures, inclinations, and
actions." But fitter subject still for the contemplative,
and still more strange, is their
marvellous, well-nigh limitless, culinary ambition.
Triumph after triumph the most modest
of them all yearns to achieve, and if this
sublime yearning be ever and always suppressed
and thwarted and misdoubted, the fault
lies with dull, plodding, unenterprising humans.
Not one yearns to such infinite purpose
as the sole; not one is so snubbed and enslaved.
A very Nora among fish, how often must it long
to escape and to live its own life&mdash;or, to be
more accurate, to die its own death!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Not that bread-crumbs and frying-pan are
not all very well in their way. Given a discreet
cook, pure virginal butter, a swift fire,
and a slice of fresh juicy lemon, something not
far short of perfection may be reached. But
other ways there are, more suggestive, more
inspiring, more godlike. Turn to the French
<i>chef</i> and learn wisdom from him.</p>

<p>First and foremost in this glorious repertory
comes <i>sole à la Normande</i>, which, under another
name, is the special distinction and pride of the
Restaurant Marguery. Take your sole&mdash;from
the waters of Dieppe would you have the best&mdash;and
place it, with endearing, lover-like caress,
in a pretty earthenware dish, with butter
for only companion. At the same time, in
sympathetic saucepan, lay mussels to the number
of two dozen, opened and well cleaned, as
a matter of course; and let each rejoice in the
society of a stimulating mushroom; when almost
done, but not quite, make of them a garland
round the expectant sole; cover their too
seductive beauty with a rich white sauce; re-kindle
their passion in the oven for a few minutes;
and serve immediately and hot. Joy is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the result; pure, uncontaminated joy. If this
be too simple for your taste, then court elaboration
and more complex sensation after this
fashion: from the first, unite the sole to two of
its most devoted admirers, the oyster and the
mussel&mdash;twelve, say, of each&mdash;and let thyme
and fragrant herbs and onion and white wine
and truffles be close witnesses of their union.
Seize the sole when it is yet but half cooked;
stretch it out gently in another dish, to which
oysters and mussels must follow in hot, precipitate
flight. And now the veiling sauce, again
white, must have calf's kidney and salt pork
for foundation, and the first gravy of the fish
for fragrance and seasoning. Mushrooms and
lemon in slices may be added to the garniture.
And if at the first mouthful you do not thrill
with rapture, the Thames will prove scarce
deep and muddy enough to hide your shame.</p>

<p>Put to severest test, the love of the sole for
the oyster is never betrayed. Would you be
convinced&mdash;and it is worth the trouble&mdash;experiment
with <i>sole farcie aux huîtres</i>, a dish so perfect
that surely, like manna, it must have come
straight from Heaven. In prosaic practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
language, it is thus composed: you stuff your
sole with forcemeat of oysters and truffles, you
season with salt and carrot and lemon, you
steep it in white wine&mdash;not sweet, or the sole
is dishonoured&mdash;you cook it in the oven, and
you serve the happy fish on a rich <i>ragoût</i> of the
oysters and truffles. Or, another tender conceit
that you may make yours to your own
great profit and enlightenment, is <i>sole farcie aux
crevettes</i>. In this case it is wise to fillet the sole
and wrap each fillet about the shrimps, which
have been well mixed and pounded with butter.
A rich <i>Béchamel</i> sauce and garniture of lemons
complete a composition so masterly that, before
it, as before a fine Velasquez, criticism is silenced.</p>

<p><i>Sole au gratin</i>, though simpler, is none the
less desirable. Let your first care be the sauce,
elegantly fashioned of butter and mushrooms
and shallots and parsley; pour a little&mdash;on
your own judgment you have best rely for exact
quantity&mdash;into a baking-dish; lay the sole
upon this liquid couch; deluge it with the remainder
of the sauce, exhilarating white wine,
and lemon juice; bury it under bread-crumbs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
and bake it until it rivals a Rembrandt in richness
and splendour.</p>

<p>In antiquarian moments, <i>fricasey soals white</i>,
and admit that your foremothers were more
accomplished artists than you. What folly to
boast of modern progress when, at table, the
Englishman of to-day is but a brute savage
compared with his ancestors of a hundred years
and more ago! But take heart: be humble,
read this golden book, and the day of emancipation
cannot be very far distant. Make your
<i>fricasey</i> as a step in the right direction. According
to the infallible book, "skin, wash,
and gut your soals very clean, cut off their
heads, dry them in a cloth, then with your
knife very carefully cut the flesh from the
bones and fins on both sides. Cut the flesh
long ways, and then across, so that each soal
will be in eight pieces; take the heads and
bones, then put them into a saucepan with a
pint of water, a bundle of sweet herbs, an
onion, a little whole pepper, two or three blades
of mace, a little salt, a very little piece of
lemon peel, and a little crust of bread. Cover
it close, let it boil till half is wasted, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
strain it through a fine sieve, put it into a stew-pan,
put in the soals and half a pint of white
wine, a little parsley chopped fine, a few mushrooms
cut small, a piece of butter as big as an
hen's egg, rolled in flour, grate a little nutmeg,
set all together on the fire, but keep shaking
the pan all the while till the fish is done
enough. Then dish it up, and garnish with
lemon." And now, what think you of that?</p>

<p>If for variety you would present a brown
<i>fricasey</i>, an arrangement in browns as startling
as a poster by Lautrec or Anquetin, add anchovy
to your seasoning, exchange white wine for red,
and introduce into the mixture truffles and morels,
and mushrooms, and a spoonful of catchup.
The beauty of the colour none can deny; the
subtlety of the flavour none can resist.</p>

<p>Another step in the right direction, which is
the old, will lead you to sole pie, a dish of
parts. Eels must be used, as is the steak in a
pigeon's pie for instance; and nutmeg and
parsley and anchovies must serve for seasoning.
It is a pleasant fancy, redolent of the days
gone by.</p>

<h2 class="p4">"BOUILLABAISSE";</h2>

<h3 class="p2"><i>A Symphony in Gold</i></h3>

<p>Hear Wagner in Baireuth (though illusions
may fly like dust before a March wind); see
Velasquez in Madrid; eat <i>Bouillabaisse</i> in Marseilles.
And eat, moreover, with no fear of
disenchantment; the saffron's gold has richer
tone, the <i>ail's</i> aroma sweeter savour, under hot
blue southern skies than in the cold sunless
north.</p>

<p>How much Thackeray is swallowed with
your <i>Bouillabaisse</i>? asks the cynical American,
vowed to all eternity to his baked shad and
soft-shelled crab; how much Thackeray? echoes
the orthodox Englishman, whose salmon, cucumberless,
smacks of heresy, and whose whiting,
if it held not its tail decorously in its
bread crumbed mouth, would be cast for ever
into outer darkness. Sentiment there may be:
not born, however, of Thackeray's verse, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of days spent in Provençal sunshine, of banquets
eaten at Provençal tables. Call for <i>Bouillabaisse</i>
in the Paris restaurant, at the Lapérouse
or Marguery's (you might call for it for a year
and a day in London restaurants and always in
vain); and if the dish brought back something
of the true flavour, over it is cast the glamour
and romance of its far southern home, of the
land of troubadours and of Tartarin. But order
it in Marseilles, and the flavour will all be
there, and the sunshine and the gaiety, and the
song as well; fact outstrips the imagination of
even the meridional; the present defies memory
to outdo its charm.</p>

<p>And it must be in the Marseilles that glitters
under midsummer's sun and grows radiant in
its light. Those who have not seen Marseilles
at this season know it not. The peevish finder
of fault raves of drainage and dynamite, of dirt
and anarchy. But turn a deaf ear and go to
Marseilles gaily and without dread. Walk out
in the early morning on the quays; the summer
sky is cloudless; the sea as blue as in the
painter's bluest dream; the hills but warm
purple shadows resting upon its waters. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
air is hot, perhaps, but soft and dry, and the
breeze blows fresh from over the Mediterranean.
Already, on every side, signs there are
of the day's coming sacrifice. In sunlight and
in shadow are piled high the sea's sweetest,
choicest fruits: mussels in their sombre purple
shells; lobsters, rich and brown; fish, scarlet
and gold and green. Lemons, freshly plucked
from near gardens, are scattered among the
fragrant pile, and here and there trail long
sprays of salt, pungent seaweed. The faint
smell of <i>ail</i> comes to you gently from unseen
kitchens, the feeling of <i>Bouillabaisse</i> is everywhere,
and tender anticipation illumines the
faces of the passers-by. Great is the pretence
of activity in the harbour and in the streets; at
a glance, mere paltry traffic might seem the
city's one and only end. But Marseilles' true
mission, the sole reason for its existence, is
that man may know how goodly a thing it is to
eat <i>Bouillabaisse</i> at noon on a warm summer day.</p>

<p>But when the hour comes, turn from the
hotel, however excellent; turn from the Provençal
version of the Parisian Duval, however
cheap and nasty; choose rather the native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
headquarters of the immortal dish. Under
pleasant awning sit out on the pavement, behind
the friendly trees in tubs that suggest
privacy, and yet hide nothing of the view beyond.
For half the joy in the steaming, golden
masterpiece is in the background found for it;
in the sunlit harbour and forest of masts; in
the classic shores where has disembarked so
many a hero, from ancient Phenician or Greek,
down to valiant Tartarin, with the brave camel
that saw him shoot all his lions! A <i>coup de vin</i>,
and, as you eat, as you watch, with eyes half
blinded, the glittering, glowing picture, you
begin to understand the meaning of the southern
<i>galéjade</i>. Your heart softens, the endless
beggars no longer beg from you in vain, while
only the slenderness of your purse keeps you
from buying out every boy with fans or matches,
every stray Moor with silly slippers and sillier
antimacassars; your imagination is kindled, so
that later, at the gay <i>café</i>, where still you sit in
the open street, as you look at the Turks and
sailors, at the Arabs and Lascars, at the Eastern
women in trousers and niggers in rags, in
a word, at Marseilles' "Congress of Nations,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
that even Barnum in his most ambitious moments
never approached, far less surpassed,
you, too, believe that had Paris but its Canebière,
it might be transformed into a little
Marseilles on the banks of the Seine. So potent
is the influence of blessed <i>Bouillabaisse</i>!</p>

<p>Or, some burning Sunday, you may rise
with the dawn and take early morning train for
Martigues, lying, a white and shining barrier,
between the Etangs de Berre and Caronte.
And there, on its bridges and canal banks, idly
watching the fishing-boats, or wandering up
and down its olive-clad hill-sides, the morning
hours may be gently loafed away, until the
Angelus rings a joyful summons to M. Bernard's
hotel in the shady <i>Place</i>. Dark and cool
is the spacious dining-room; eager and attentive
the bewildered Désirée. Be not a minute
late, for M. Bernard's <i>Bouillabaisse</i> is justly
famed, and not only all Marseilles, but all the
country near hastens thither to eat it on Sundays,
when it is served in its <i>édition de luxe</i>.
Pretty Arlésiennes in dainty fichus, cyclists in
knickerbockers, rich Marseillais, painters from
Paris join in praise and thanksgiving. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
from one end of the world to the other, you
might journey in vain in search of an emotion
so sweet as that aroused by the first fragrant
fumes of the dish set before you, the first rapturous
taste of the sauce-steeped bread, of the
strange fish so strangely seasoned.</p>

<p>But why, in any case, remain content with
salmon alone when <i>Bouillabaisse</i> can be made,
even in dark and sunless England? Quite the
same it can never be as in the land of sunburnt
mirth and jollity. The light and the brilliancy
and the gaiety of its background must be ever
missing in the home of fog and spleen. The
gay little fish of the Mediterranean never swim
in the drear, unresponsive waters that break on
the white cliffs of England and the stern rocks
of the Hebrides. But other fish there be, in
great plenty, that, in the absence of the original,
may answer as praiseworthy copies.</p>

<p>After all, to cut turbot and whiting and soles
and trout in small pieces, to cook them all together,
instead of each separately, is not the
unpardonable sin, however the British housewife
may protest to the contrary. And as to
the other ingredients, is not good olive oil sold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
in bottles in many a London shop? Are sweet
herbs and garlic unknown in Covent Garden?
Are there no French and Italian grocers in
Soho, with whom saffron is no less a necessity
than mustard or pepper? And bread? who
would dare aver that England has no bakers?</p>

<p>It is not a difficult dish to prepare. Its cooks
may not boast of secrets known only to themselves,
like the maker of process blocks or
patent pills. Their methods they disclose without
reservation, though alas! their genius they
may not so easily impart. First of all, then,
see to your sauce: oil, pure and sweet, is its
foundation; upon <i>ail</i> and herbs of the most aromatic
it depends for its seasoning. In this,
place your fish selected and mixed as fancy
prompts; a whiting, a sole&mdash;filleted of course&mdash;a
small proportion of turbot, and as much salmon,
if solely for the touch of colour it gives&mdash;the
artist never forgets to appeal to the eye as
to the palate. Boil thoroughly, sprinkling at
the last moment sympathetic saffron on the
sweet-smelling offering. Have ready thick
slices of bread daintily arranged in a convenient
dish; just before serving pour over them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the greater part of the unrivalled sauce, now
gold and glorious with its saffron tint; pour
the rest, with the fish, into another dish&mdash;a
bowl, would you be quite correct&mdash;and let as
few seconds as possible elapse between dishing
this perfect work of art and eating it. Upon
its smell alone man might live and thrive. Its
colour is an inspiration to the painter, the subtlety
of its flavour a text to the poet. Montenard
and Dauphin may go on, year after year,
painting olive-lined roads and ports of Toulon:
the true Provençal artist will be he who fills
his canvas with the radiance and richness of
<i>Bouillabaisse</i>.</p>

<p>Would you emulate M. Bernard and make a
<i>Bouillabaisse de luxe</i> it may prove a tax upon
your purse, but not upon your powers. For
when thus lavishly inclined, you but add lobster
or crab or crayfish and the needed luxury is
secured. It is a small difference in the telling,
but in the eating, how much, how unspeakable is
this little more! Easily satisfied indeed must
be the prosaic mortal who, having once revelled
in <i>Bouillabaisse de luxe</i>, would ever again still
his cravings with the simpler arrangement.</p>

<h2 class="p4 center">THE MOST EXCELLENT<br />
OYSTER</h2>

<p>If, in cruel December, the vegetable fails us,
in another direction we may look for and find&mdash;if
we be wise and liberal&mdash;novelty without
stint. From the oyster, when it is understood
aright, spring perpetual joy and rapturous surprises.
But, sad to tell, in England men have
slighted it and misdoubted its greatness. Englishmen
eat it and declare it good; but, as with
salad, they know not how to prepare it. Because
it is excellent in its rawness, they can
imagine no further use for it, unless, perhaps,
to furnish a rich motive for sauce, or sometimes
for soup. Even raw&mdash;again like salad&mdash;they
are apt to brutalise it. To drown it in vinegar
is the height of their ambition; an imperial
pint was the quantity needed by Mr Weller's
friend to destroy the delicacy of its flavour, the
salt sweetness of its aroma. The Greeks knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
better: according to Athenæus, boiled and fried
they served their oysters, finding them, however,
best of all when roasted in the coals till
the shells opened. As early as the seventeenth
century, the French, preparing them <i>en étuvée</i>
and <i>en fricassée</i>, included them in their <i>Délices de
la campagne</i>. The American to-day exhausts his
genius for invention in devising rare and cunning
methods by which to extract their full
strength and savour. Why should Englishmen
tarry behind the other peoples on the earth in
paying the oyster the tribute of sympathetic
appreciation?</p>

<p>Its merit when raw, no man of sensibility
and wisdom will deny. Base-minded, indeed,
must be he who thinks to enhance its value by
converting it into a defence against influenza
or any other human ill. The ancients held it
indigestible unless cooked; but to talk of it as
if it were a drug for our healing, a poison for
our discomforting, is to dishonour, without
rhyme or reason, the noblest of all shell-fish.
Who would not risk an indigestion, or worse,
for the pleasure raw oysters have it in their
power to give? Was there one, among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
wedding guests at the "Marriage of Hebe,"
who feared the course of "oysters with closed
shells, which are very difficult to open but very
easy to eat"?</p>

<p>Easy to eat, yes; but first you must decide
which, of the many varieties of oyster the sea
offers, you had best order for your own delight.
There are some men who, with Thackeray,
rank the "dear little juicy green oysters of
France" above the "great white flaccid natives
in England, that look as if they had been fed
on pork." To many, the coppery taste of this
English native passes for a charm&mdash;poor deluded
creatures! To others it seems the very
abomination of desolation. But the true epicure,
who may not have them, as had oyster-loving
Greeks of old, from Abydus or Chalcedon,
will revel most of all in the American
species: the dainty little Blue-Point, or its
long, sweet, plump brother of the north&mdash;to
swallow it was like swallowing a baby, Thackeray
thought.</p>

<p>Once your oysters are on the half shell, let
not the vinegar bottle tempt you; as far as it is
concerned, be not only temperate, but a total
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
abstainer. A sprinkling of salt, a touch of
Cayenne, a dash of lemon juice, and then eat,
and know how good it is for man to live in a
world of oysters. For a light lunch or the perfect
midnight supper, for an inspiring <i>hors
d'&oelig;uvre</i>, without rival is this king of shell-fish.
If for the midnight meal you reserve it, you
may be kindled into ecstasy by the simple addition
of a glass of fine old Chablis or Sauterne&mdash;be
not led astray by vulgar praise of stout or
porter&mdash;and brown bread and butter cut in
slices of ethereal thinness. Linger over this
banquet, exquisite in its simplicity, long and
lovingly, that later you may sleep with easy
conscience and mind at rest.</p>

<p>With raw oysters alone it were folly to remain
content. If you would spread a more
sumptuous feast, fry the largest, plumpest
grown in sea or river, and the gates of earthly
paradise will be thrown wide open in the frying.
No more familiar cry is there in American
restaurants than that for "an oyster fry!"
Dark little oyster cellars, reached by precipitous
steps, there are, and friendly seedy little
oyster shops in back streets, where the frying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of oysters has been exalted into a holy cult.
And if you will, in paper boxes, the long, beautiful,
golden-brown masterpieces you may carry
away with you, to eat with gayer garnishing
and in more sympathetic surroundings. And
in winter, scarce a beer saloon but, at luncheon
time, will set upon the counter a steaming dish
of fried oysters; and with every glass of no
matter what, "crackers" at discretion and one
fried oyster on long generous fork will be
handed by the white-robed guardian. But
mind you take but one: else comes the
chucker-out. Thus, only the very thirsty, in
the course of a morning, may gain a free lunch.
But, in England, what is known of the fried
oyster?</p>

<p>It requires no great elaboration, though much
rare skill in the cooking. For this purpose the
largest oysters must be selected: the fattest
and most juicy. In the half-shell they may be
fried, after seventeenth-century fashion, a touch
of butter and pepper on each; verjuice or vinegar,
and grated nutmeg added once they are
served. Or else, taken from the shell, they
may be dipped into a marvellous preparation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of vinegar, parsley, laurel leaves, onion, chives,
cloves, basil, and in the result the mighty imagination
of the great Alexandre would rejoice.
Or, again, in simpler American fashion, enveloped
in unpretentious batter of eggs and bread
crumbs, fry them until they turn to an unrivalled,
indescribable golden-brown, and in the
eating thereof the gods might envy you.</p>

<p>If a new sensation you court, grill or broil
your oyster, and you will have cause to exult
in a loud triumphant <i>magnificat</i>. No bread
crumbs are needed, neither laurel nor sweet
spice. With but a bit of butter for encouragement,
it will brown gently in the grilling, and
become a delicious morsel to be eaten with
reverence and remembered with tenderness.</p>

<p>Or, stew them and be happy. But of rich
milk, and cream, and sweet fresh butter, as
Dumas would put it, must your stew be made:
thickened, but scarce perceptibly, with flour,
while bits of mace float in golden sympathy on
the liquid's surface. It is the dish for luncheon,
or for the pleasant, old-fashioned "high
tea"&mdash;no such abomination as "meat tea" known
then, if you please&mdash;of Philadelphia's pleasant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
old-fashioned citizens. And a worse accompaniment
you might have than waffles, light as
a feather, or beaten biscuits, the pride of Maryland's
black cooks. Men and women from the
Quaker city, when in cruel exile, will be moved
to sad tears at the very mention of Jones's
"oyster stews" in Eleventh-street!</p>

<p>But the glory of Penn's town is the oyster
croquette&mdash;from Augustine's by preference. A
symphony in golden brown and soft fawn grey,
it should be crisp without, within of such delicate
consistency that it will melt in the mouth
like a dream. Pyramidal in shape, it is of
itself so decorative that only with the rarest
blue and white china, or the most fairy-like
Limoges, will it seem in perfect harmony. It
would be discourteous, indeed, to serve so
regal a creation on any stray dish or plate.</p>

<p>Exquisite pleasure lurks in scalloped oysters,
or oysters <i>au gratin</i>, whichever you may choose
to call this welcome variation of the oyster
motive. Layers of judiciously seasoned bread-crumbs
alternate with layers of the responsive
shell-fish, and the carefully-studied arrangement
is then browned until it enchants by colour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
no less than by fragrance. And, if you
would seek further to please the eye, let the
dish to hold so fine a work of art be a shell,
with a suggestion of the sea in its graceful
curves and tender tints. Or, if imagination
would be more daring, let the same shell hold
<i>huîtres farcies</i>, cunningly contrived with eels
and oysters, and parsley and mushrooms, and
spices and cream, and egg and aromatic herbs.
So fantastic a contrivance as this touches upon
sublimity.</p>

<p>In more homely and convivial mood, roast
your oysters, as the Greeks loved them. But
to enjoy them to the utmost, roast them yourself
in the coals of your own fire, until the
ready shells open. A dash of salt and cayenne
upon the sweet morsel within, and you may eat
it at once, even as you take it from off the coals,
and drink its salt, savoury liquor from the shell.
A dish of anchovy toast will not seem amiss.
But let no other viands coarsen this ideal supper.
For supper it should be, and nothing
else. The curtains must be drawn close, while
the fire flames high; one or two congenial
friends&mdash;not more; a dim religious light from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
well-shaded lamps and candles; a bottle of
good old Chablis, and others waiting in near
wine-cellar or sideboard; and thus may you
make your own such unspeakable happiness as
seldom falls to the lot of mortals.</p>

<p>Or if to the past your fancy wanders, prepare
your oysters, seventeenth century-fashion, <i>en
étuvée</i>, boiled in their own liquor, flavoured
with ingredients so various as oranges and
chives, and served with bread-crumbs; or else,
<i>en fricassée</i>, cooked with onion and butter,
dipped in batter, and sprinkled with orange
juice. Or again, in sheer waywardness, curry
or devil them, though in this disguise no man
may know the delicacy he is eating. Another
day, bake them; the next, put them in a pie or
a patty; the third, let them give substance to a
<i>vol-au-vent</i>. Hesitate at no experiment; search
the cookery-books, old and new. Be sure that
the oyster, in its dictionary, knows no such
word as fail. If in sheer recklessness you
were, like young Mr Grigg in the Cave of Harmony,
to call for a "mashed oyster and scalloped
'taters," no doubt the "mashed" would
be forthcoming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
As basis of soup or sauce, the oyster is without
rival. Who would not abstain on Fridays
all the year round, if every Friday brought
with it oyster soup to mortify the flesh! But
alas! four months there be without an R, when
oysters by the wise must not be eaten. And is
not turbot, or boiled capon, or a tender loin-steak
but the excuse for oyster sauce? in which,
if you have perfection for your end, let there be
no stint of oysters. Then, too, in the stuffing
of a fowl, oysters prove themselves the worthy
rival of mushrooms or of chestnuts.</p>

<p>It is a grave mistake, however, to rank the
oyster as the only shell-fish of importance. The
French know better. So did the Greeks, if
Athenæus can be trusted. Mussels, oysters,
scallops, and cockles led the list, according to
Diocles, the Carystian. Thus are they enumerated
by still another authority:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A little polypus, or a small cuttle-fish,</div>
<div class="line">A crab, a crawfish, oysters, cockles,</div>
<div class="line">Limpets and solens, mussels and pinnas;</div>
<div class="line">Periwinkles, too, from Mitylene.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The mussel is still the delight of the French
<i>table d'hôte</i> breakfast. Charming to look at is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the deep dish where, floating in parsley-strewn
sauce, the beautiful purple shells open gently
to show the golden-grey treasures within. Well
may the commercial in the provinces heap high
his plate with the food he loves, while about
him hungry men stare, wondering how much
will be left for their portion. But who in England
eats mussels? Only a little lower the
Greeks ranked periwinkles, which now, associated
as they are with 'Arriet and her pin, the
fastidious affect to despise. It has been written
of late, by a novelist seeking to be witty,
that there is no poetry in periwinkles; but
Æschylus could stoop to mention them in his
great tragedies. The "degradation of the
lower classes" the same weak wit attributes to
overindulgence in winkles. With as much
reason might the art and philosophy of Greece
be traced to "periwinkles from Mitylene."
Cooked in the good sauce of France, the humble
winkle might take rank with the Whitstable
native at three-and-six the dozen, and thus
would the lowly be exalted. The snail, likewise,
we might cultivate to our own immeasurable
advantage.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE PARTRIDGE</h2>

<p>With September, the <i>gourmand's</i> fancy gaily
turns to thoughts of partridges. For his pleasure
sportsmen, afar in autumn's cool country,
work diligently from morn to eve; or, it may
be, he himself plays the sportsman by day that
he may prove the worthier <i>gourmand</i> by night.
And the bird is deserving of his affections. It
has been honoured alike in history and romance.</p>

<p>Among moderns, a Daudet is found to study
and consider its emotions under fire; among
ancients, few neglected it, from Aristophanes
to Aristotle, who declared it "a very ill-disposed
and cunning animal; much devoted,
moreover, to amatory enjoyment." With such
a character, its two hearts count for little; far
gone, indeed, must be the sentimentalist of our
moral age who would stay its slayer's hand.
What if it be true, as Chamæleon of Pontus
said of old, that from listening to its singing in
desert places man arrived at the art of music?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Alive it may have an æsthetic value; but if it
be without morals should it not perish? In
eating it, therefore, does not man perform a
solemn duty? Nay, should not the New Woman
exult in flaunting its sober feathers in her
masculine hat?</p>

<p>So might reason the apostle of social purity.
But the <i>gourmand</i> questions nothing save the
daintiness of the bird's flesh, the merit of its
flavour. And the practical answer to this questioning
silences all doubts. Clearly the partridge
was created that he might eat it and
find it good.</p>

<p>It is because of the rare excellence of the
pretty bird, in autumn making a feathered
frieze in every poulterer's window, that too
much consideration cannot be given to its treatment
in the kitchen. Its virtues can be easily
marred by the indifferent, or unsympathetic
<i>chef</i>. Left hanging too short a time, left cooking
too long, and it will sink into commonplace,
so that all might wonder wherefore its
praises have been ever loudly sung. Hang it
in a cool place, and leave it there until the last
moment possible&mdash;you understand? Now that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
winds are cold, and a feeling of frost is in the
air, to banish it a fortnight would not be unwise.</p>

<p>To roast a partridge may seem a sadly simple
device when so many more ingenious schemes
are at your disposal. But for all that, none
can be recommended with enthusiasm more
keenly felt. For in the roasting none of its
sweet savour is lost, none of its natural tenderness
sacrificed on the one hand, exaggerated on
the other. The process requires less intelligence
than an artistic touch. Truss your birds
in seemly fashion, when, as if in birdlike emulation
of Hedda Gabler, they cry for vine leaves
on their breast. Over the vine leaves tie less
romantic, but more succulent, bacon, cut in
slices of the thinnest. Then, in front of a
quick, clear fire baste prodigally with butter.
A little flour, judiciously sprinkled, will add
richness to the nut-brown colour the susceptible
birds develop in the roasting. Now they are
ready to serve, remember that "partridges
should have gravy in the dish, and bread-sauce
in a cup"&mdash;it is Mrs Glasse who has said it. It
would be no crime to add watercress, or parsley,
as garniture, or toast as a soft bed for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
happy victims. And to eat with them, prepare
a crisp lettuce salad, to which the merest suspicion
of tarragon leaves, well chopped, has
been added. And the gods themselves might
envy you your joy and gladness in the eating.</p>

<p>A word as to the carving, or "dissection of
the partridge," as it was called in days when
England understood and gloried in the arts of
the kitchen. Thus was the <i>Grand Escuyer Tranchant</i>&mdash;the
Great Master carver, that is&mdash;instructed:
"A partridge is for the most part
carved and served whole, like a pigeon; but
yet he may be served in pieces; but when you
will carve him to serve whole, you must only
cut the joints and lay them abroad; but if you
serve him by pieces, you must begin to serve
with a wing." Why not carve and serve according
to tradition, and so lend new dignity to
your feasting?</p>

<p>If of roast partridge you weary, and from
France would take a hint, seek novelty and
happiness in <i>Perdrix aux choux</i>. For this, birds
of an older generation will answer as well as
their more tender young, since for two hours,
in a wrapping of bacon and buttered paper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
they must simmer gently on their couch of cabbage.
To evolve the required flavour, into the
same pot must go a saveloy, and perhaps salt
pork in slices, a bunch of fragrant herbs, onions
and carrots and cloves and salt and butter <i>à discrétion</i>.
The birds must be drained before they
pass from the pot to the dish; around them the
cabbage, likewise drained, must be set as a
garland, and the saveloy, in pretty pieces, may
be placed here and there. Behold another of
the many good gifts France has presented to
us.</p>

<p><i>Perdrix à l'Espagnole</i> may again vary anew
the delicious monotony. In this variety the
partridges are boiled, covered with a rich
gravy, and plentifully adorned with green peppers.
It was in a moment of divine inspiration
the Spaniard invented so piquant an arrangement.
But the resources of boiled partridges,
apt to be forgotten or overlooked, are well-nigh
limitless, and as charming as they are many.
Very important is it that the birds be well
boiled, quickly, in much water. The rest depends
upon the sauce. This may be of cream
and butter alone; or else of celery and cream,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
seasoned with mace and pepper. Or else of
mushrooms and cream, or of the livers and
parsley and butter; or of white wine; or of any
and every good thing that goes to the making
of superlative sauce. What a chance, too, to
exercise your imagination, to reveal your ingenuity!
Five long months are before you;
see that you make the most of them.</p>

<p>If your soul delight in the fantastic, let few
days pass before you have tested the quaint
joys of <i>Partridge Mettenes</i>. The recipe shall be
printed word for word as written by the Master
Cook, Giles: "Take Partridges and roast them,
then take Cream"&mdash;these with capitals, observe&mdash;"and
Grapes, with Bread, scorched against
the Fire, and beat all this together; but first
steep your Bread in Broth or Claret-Wine; then
strain all this through a strainer with Spice,
Cinnamon, and a little Mustard; set all a-boyling
with a pretty deal of Sugar, but take heed
that it doth not burn too, and when you would
serve away your Partridge, put them into a
Dish, and your Sauce under them, and garnish
your Dish with Sweetmeats and Sugarplums."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Here is another device, fantastic chiefly in
name: "Partridges <i>à l'eau béniste</i> or Holy
Water." It has the virtue of simplicity.
"Take partridges and rost them, and when
they are rosted, cut them into little pieces, and
put them into a Dish with a little fair Water
and Salt, and make them boyl a little, and so
serve them away." Or else, O pleasant alternative!
"you may make a Sauce with Rose-water
and Wine, the Juice of Apples and
Oranges, but there must be three times as
much Rose-water as Wine."</p>

<p>Reading this, who will dare deny that Master
Cook Giles is an authority to be respected,
of whose recipes the poor prosaic modern
kitchen may not receive too many? Space,
therefore, must be yielded to at least one more:
"Partridges à la Tonnelette." "Take a partridge
and rost it, then put it into a Pot; this
done, take white Bread and scortch or toste it
very brown, but not burn it, and put it a-steeping
in good Claret-wine, and when it is well
steep'd strain it through a strainer with some
good Broth, and a few Onions fryed in Lard,
with a little Cinnamon, Cloves, and Nutmegs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and other small Spices, and a little Sugar, and
put into it a handful of Currants, and make
that which you have strained out boyl all together,
and when it is time to serve your Partridges,
put your Sauces into a Dish, and lay
your Partridges upon it, and so serve it."</p>

<p>Such pretty fancies, it were a shame to follow
with bald prose. Yet, bear in mind that
partridges may be braised with mushrooms or
truffles; that they may be broiled or baked;
that they disgrace neither pie nor pudding;
and that they offer welcome basis for a <i>salmi</i>
and <i>purée</i>. Lay this to heart.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE ARCHANGELIC BIRD</h2>

<p>Michaelmas is a season of sad associations.
The quarter's rent is due, alas! The quarter's
gas, alas! and, alas a hundred times! the half-yearly
rates. Bank accounts dwindle; spirits
sink; life seems but a blank and dreary desert.</p>

<p>Into the gloom, settling down thicker and
more throttling than November's fog, there
flutters and waddles a big white bird, a saviour
of men. It is the noble goose, the goose,
ridiculed and misunderstood, that comes chivalrously
and fearlessly to the rescue; the goose
that once saved Rome's Capitol, the goose still
honoured as most alert of sentinels within Barcelona's
cathedral precincts, the goose that,
followed by a goose-girl, is the beloved of artists.
Because of its nobility of character, its
devotion, wherein it rivals benevolent mastiff
and kindly terrier, its courage, its strength, St
Michael, glorious and effulgent archangel, took
it for his own bird of birds, to be so intimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
connected with him that now to show respect
to the Saint is to eat the goose. The Feast of
Michaelmas, to the right-minded and the orthodox,
means roast goose and apple sauce. Soulless
authorities, burrowing in mouldy records,
can find no better reason for this close relationship
than that, at September's close, great is
the number of geese cackling in homely barnyard,
great their perfection. Numerous generations
since England's fourth Edward sat
upon the throne (and who can say how many
before his time?), have held the cooking of the
goose for dinner as no less sacred a ceremony
on the Angel's feast day than the morning's
service in church. And this, would the pugnacious
Michael have permitted for such gross
material considerations? Never; let it be said
once and for all: never. He knew the goose
for the bird that lays the golden egg; he knew
full well its dignity and might that make it still
a terror to be met on lonely common by them
who use its name as symbol of silliness; he
knew that strong as well as faint hearted hesitate
to say "Bo" discourteously to any goose,
whether it be a wanderer in French pastures or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
one of the dust-raising flock, in the twilight,
cackling homeward over Transylvanian highways.
In a word, Michael knew his bird; and
our duty it is to believe in it a dish for Michaelmas
with the blind, unquestioning allegiance of
perfect faith. Coarse its flesh may be in
comparison with the dainty duck and tender
chicken; commonplace in comparison with the
glorious grouse and proud partridge. The
modest, respectable <i>bourgeois</i> it may seem among
poultry. And yet, if the Archangel has chosen
it for his own, who shall say him nay? Study
rather to disguise its native coarseness, to enliven
its excellent dulness.</p>

<p>To roast it is the simplest form the Michaelmas
celebration allows. See first that your fire
be very good; take care to singe the sacrificial
goose with a piece of white paper, and baste it
with a piece of butter; drudge it (the word is
Mrs Glasse's) with a little flour, and when the
smoke begins to draw to the fire, and it looks
plump, baste it again and drudge it with a little
flour, and take it up. In sober mood, stuff
it with sage and onion; in more flamboyant
moments, let your choice rest upon chestnuts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Tradition insists upon a little good gravy in a
basin by itself, and some apple-sauce in another;
but sauce of gooseberries, not to be had
fresh, however, for Michaelmas, is the <i>gourmet's</i>
choice.</p>

<p>A hint as to carving. How many a beautiful
bird, or majestic joint, has been shamelessly
insulted by ill-trained carver! Of old the master
of the household accepted the "dissection of
a goose" after the High Dutch fashion and the
Italian both, his own predilections leaning
rather toward the High Dutch, "for they cut
the breast into more pieces, and so by consequence
fill more Plates"&mdash;good thrifty burghers
that they were. Learn then, and master "the
order how they carve and how they send it
away; as (1), on the first Plate a thigh; (2),
another thigh; (3), a side of the rump, with a
piece of the breast; (4), the other side of the
rump, with another piece of the breast; (5), a
wing; (6), the other wing; (7), the rest of the
stomach, upon which, if there be little of the
brawn left, you may joyn the two small forked
bones; to the eighth, the merry-thought, with
the rest of the rump, and any else, at your discretion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
If you will, you may join some of the
breast with the best piece which you always
present to the most considerable person at the
table first, and take notice too, by the bye,
the brawn of the breast ought to be for the
most part served out first." Give heed unto
these directions, and far wrong you may not
go.</p>

<p>Days are when simple expression of faith is
all too inadequate. The devout yearns for
something more ornate, something more elaborate.
Let the outcome of this yearning be <i>oie
à la chipolata</i>, and Michael in Paradise will smell
the sweet savour and smile. It is difficult, but
delicious. Cover the bottom of your stew-pan
with lard; place upon it two or three slices of
beef and ham, a bouquet of parsley and chives,
three carrots and two or three onions, a touch
of garlic, a few cloves, thyme, laurel leaves,
basil, and salt, and thus you will have prepared
a sweet, soft bed for your goose. Immediately
disturb the bird's slumbers by pouring
over it a glass of good Madeira, a bottle of
white wine, a glass of cognac, and two or three
spoonfuls of strong bouillon made of fowls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Now put your pan on the fire, stew your goose
for an hour, lift it out, arrange it on a fair
dish, and envelop it in the very richest <i>chipolata</i>
it is in your power to make. And what is a
<i>chipolata</i>? An Italian creation half sauce, half
<i>ragoût</i>; fashioned of carrots and turnips, and
chestnuts and onions, and sausage and mushrooms,
and artichokes and celery, and strong
veal gravy.</p>

<p>Archangelic smiles must broaden into silent
laughter at the mere mention of "a Potage of
Green Geese." It is a conceit redolent of the
olden time, when gaiety was still ranked among
the cardinal virtues, and men ate their fill with
no fear of a dyspeptic to-morrow. Since it is
an ancient masterpiece, in the ancient words
must it be explained, or else it will be dishonoured
in the telling. "Take your Green-geese
and boyl them the usual way, and when they
are boyled take them up and fry them whole in
a frying-pan to colour them, either with the fat
of bacon or hog's-lard, called nowadays <i>manège
de pork</i>; then take ginger, long pepper, and
cloves; beat all this together, and season them
with this spice; a little parsley and sage, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
put them into a little of the same broth that
they were boyled in, and sprinkle a little grated
cheese over them, and let them have a little
stew, and then dish them up with sipets under
them." A brave disguise, truly, for humblest
goose.</p>

<p>In a pie likewise&mdash;unless the fashioning
thereof be entrusted to the indiscreet cook&mdash;it
presents a brave appearance. Walls of crust
line a spacious dish; a pickled dried tongue is
boiled; a fowl and a goose are boned; seasoning
is wrought of mace, beaten pepper, and
salt; and then, Oh the marvel of it! fowl is
lain in the goose, tongue in the fowl, goose in
the dish. A half a pound of butter separates
bird from pastry cover. And, hot or cold,
pleasure may be had in the eating. Not the
highest pleasure, perhaps, but still pleasure
not to be scorned.</p>

<p>If you would boil a goose, see, as you respect
your stomach, that it be first salted for a week.
With onion sauce it may be becomingly adorned,
or again, with simple cabbage, boiled, chopped
small, and stewed in butter. Or, plunge gaily
into the <i>rococo</i> style, and decorate it <i>à l' Arlésienne</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
stuffed with onions and chestnuts, boiled
in company with carrots and celery and onions
and parsley and cloves, floated in tomato sauce,
it is as chock full of playful surprises as the
<i>Cartuja</i> of Granada. Another device to be
recommended is the grilling of the legs and
the serving them with <i>laitues farcies</i>&mdash;and Michael
will laugh outright; or <i>à la Provençale</i>,
and words fail; or <i>aux tomates</i>, the love-apples
that not the hardest heart can resist. Of the
great and good Carême these are the suggestions;
treasure them up, therefore, where memory
may not rust or aspiration decay, for the
dinner may come when you will be glad to
have them at hand.</p>

<p>Of the giblets and liver of the goose is there
not a long, exultant chapter yet to be written?
In far Strasburg geese, in perpetual darkness
and torture, fatten with strange morbid fat,
that the sensitive, who shrink from a bull fight
and cry out against the cruelty of the cockpit,
may revel in <i>pâté de foie gras</i>. So long as the
world lives, may there still be this delectable
<i>pâté</i> to delight. But why not be honest: admit
that between the torture of the bull that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
may see, and the torture of the goose that we
may eat, difference there is none? Give sensitiveness
full play, and sordid vegetarianism is
the logical result.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><a id="Page_134"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">SPRING CHICKEN</h2>

<p>Gluttony, it has been written&mdash;and with
wisdom&mdash;deserves nothing but praise and encouragement.
For two reasons. "Physically,
it is the result and proof of the digestive organs
being perfect. Morally, it shows implicit resignation
to the commands of nature, who, in
ordering man to eat that he may live, gives
him appetite to invite, flavour to encourage,
and pleasure to reward." But there is a third
reason, too often overlooked even by the professional
glutton: love of good eating is an
incentive to thought, a stimulus to the imagination.
The man of the most active mind and
liveliest fancy is he who eats well and conscientiously
considers each dish as it is set before
him.</p>

<p>The test seldom fails. Run through the list
of poets and painters of your acquaintance; do
not they who eat best write the finest verse and
paint the strongest pictures? Those who pretend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
indifference and live on unspeakable
messes are betrayed in the foolish affectation
and tedious eccentricity of their work; those
who feel indifference are already beyond hope
and had better far be selling tape across counters
or adding up figures in loathsome ledgers.
Memory, borrowing from her store-house of
treasures, lingers with tender appreciation and
regret upon one unrivalled breakfast, exquisitely
cooked, exquisitely served, and exquisitely
eaten, when lilacs were sweet and horse-chestnuts
blossoming in the boulevards and
avenues of Paris. And he upon whose table
the banquet was spread is an artist who towers
head and shoulders above the pigmies of his
generation. It were rash, indeed, to maintain
that because he eats daintily therefore he paints
like the master he is; but who, on the other
hand, would dare aver that because he paints
supremely well therefore is he the prince of
<i>gourmets</i>? Here cause and effect are not to be
defined by cold logic, not to be labelled by
barren philosophy. One thing alone is certain;
if love of good eating will not create genius it
can but develop it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Consequently, it would be impossible to
think too much of what you are eating to-day
and purpose to eat to-morrow. It is your duty
above all things to see that your food is in harmony
with place and season. The question
now is, what beast or bird is fitting holocaust
for the first warm months of spring? Beef is
too heating, too substantial; mutton too monotonous,
veal too prosaic. Lamb hath charm,
but a charm that by constant usage may be
speedily exhausted. Does not mint sauce, pall
at times? Place, then, your trust in the poultry-yard
that your pleasure may be long in the
spring.</p>

<p>To begin with, poultry pleases because of
its idyllic and pastoral associations. The
plucked birds, from shop windows, flaunting
their nakedness in the face of the world, recall
the old red-roofed farmhouse among the elms,
and the pretty farmer's daughter in neat, fresh
gingham, scattering grain in the midst of her
feathered favourites; they suggest the first cool
light of dawn and the irrepressible cock crowing
the glad approach of day; in a word, they
are reminders of the country's simple joys&mdash;unendurable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
at the time, dear and sacred when
remembered in town.</p>

<p>The gentle little spring chicken is sweet and
adorable above all its kindred poultry. It is
innocent and guileless as Bellini's angels,
dream-like and strange as Botticelli's. It is the
very concentration of spring; as your teeth
meet in its tender, yielding flesh, you think,
whether you will or no, of violets and primroses,
and hedgerows white with may; you feel
the balmy breath of the south wind; the world
is scented for you with lilac and narcissus; and,
for the time being, life is a perfect poem. But&mdash;why
is there always a but?&mdash;your cook has it
in her power to ruin the rhythm, to make of
melodious lyric the most discordant prose. No
less depends upon the being who cooks the
chicken than upon the hen who laid the egg.
If hitherto you have offended through heedlessness,
see now that you approach the subject
with a determination to profit.</p>

<p>Of all ways of cooking a spring chicken, frying
is first to be commended; and of all ways
of frying the American is most sympathetic.
Fried chicken! To write the word is to be carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
back to the sunny South; to see, in the
mind's eye, the old, black, fat, smiling <i>mammie</i>,
in gorgeous bandana turban, and the little
black piccaninnies bringing in relays of hot
muffins. Oh, the happy days of the long ago!
It is easy to give the <i>recipe</i>, but what can it
avail unless the <i>mammie</i> goes with it? Another
admirable device is in broiling. One fashion
is to divide your chicken down the back and
flatten it, seeing, as you have a heart within
you, that no bones be broken. Set it lovingly
on a trivet placed for the purpose in a baking-tin
into which water, to the depth of an
inch, has been poured. Cover your tin; bake
the sweet offering for ten minutes or so; take
it from the oven; touch it delicately with the
purest of pure olive oil, and for another ten
minutes broil it over a good brisk fire. And
if in the result you do not taste heaven, hasten
to the hermit's cell in the desert, and, for the
remainder of your days, grow thin on lentils
and dates.</p>

<p>Or, if you would broil your chicken after the
fashion of infallible Mrs Glasse, slit it as before,
season it with pepper and salt, lay it on a clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
fire at a great distance, broil first the inside,
then the out, cover it with delicate bread-crumbs,
and let it be of a fine brown, but not
burnt. And keep this note carefully in your
mind: "You may make just what sauce you
fancy."</p>

<p>To roast a spring chicken will do no harm,
but let it not be overdone. Twenty minutes
suffice for the ceremony. Bacon, in thinnest
of thin slices, gracefully rolled, is not unworthy
to be served with it. In boiling, something of
its virginal flavour may be sacrificed, but still
there is compensating gain; it may be eaten
with white mushroom sauce, made of mushrooms
and cream, and seasoned with nutmeg
and mace. Here is a poem, sweeter far than
all songs of immortal choirs or the weak pipings
of our minor singers.</p>

<p>As the chicken outgrows the childish state,
you may go to Monte Carlo in search of one
hint at least, for its disposal. There you will
learn to cut it into quarters, to stew it in wine
and shallots, to add, at the psychological moment,
tomatoes in slices, and to serve a dish
that baffles description. Or you may journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
to Spain, and find that country's kitchen slandered
when you eat <i>poulet au ris à l' Espagnole</i>,
chicken cooked in a <i>marmite</i> with rice, artichokes,
green and red chillies, and salad oil, and
served, where the artist dwells, in the blessed
<i>marmite</i> itself&mdash;in unimaginative London, even,
you may buy one, green or brown, whichever
you will, at a delightful shop in Shaftsbury-avenue.
Again, you may wander to Holland&mdash;it
is a short journey, and not disagreeable by
way of Harwich&mdash;and be ready to swear that
no fashion can surpass the Dutch of boiling
chickens with rice or vermicelli, spicing them
with pepper and cloves, and, at table, substituting
for sauce sugar and cinnamon. But to omit
these last two garnishments will not mean a
mortal sin upon your conscience. In more
festive mood hasten at once to France, and
there you will be no less certain that the way
of ways is to begin to broil your chicken, already
quartered, but, when half done, to put it
in a stew-pan with gravy, and white wine, salt
and pepper, fried veal balls, onions, and shallots,
and, according to season, gooseberries or
grapes. Do you not grow hungry as you read?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
But wait: this is not all. As the beautiful
mixture is stewing&mdash;on a charcoal fire if possible&mdash;thicken
the liquor with yolks of eggs and
the juice of lemon, and for ever after bless Mrs
Glasse for having initiated you into these noble
and ennobling mysteries.</p>

<p>Braise your chicken, fricassee it, make it into
mince, croquettes, krameskies; eat it cold;
convert it into galantine; bury it in aspic; do
what you will with it, so long as you do it well,
it can bring you but happiness and peace.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE MAGNIFICENT MUSHROOM</h2>

<p>From remote ages dates the triumph of the
mushroom&mdash;the majestic, magnificent mushroom.
Glorious Greeks feasted on it and were
glad. What say Poliochus and Antiphanes?
What Athenæus? In verse only, could be duly
praised those fragrant mushrooms of old, which
were roasted for dinner and eaten with delicate
snails caught in the dewy morning, and olives
tenderly pounded; washed down with wine,
good if not over strong or of famous vintage.
O the simple, happy days of long ago!</p>

<p>There are times when the classic simplicity
and dignity of the Greek you may emulate, and
your amusement find in mushrooms dressed
with vinegar, or honey and vinegar, or honey,
or salt. But then, all other courses must be in
keeping. The snails and olives must not be
omitted. Maize there must be, well winnowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
from the chaff, and rich, ripe purple figs. And,
who knows? the full flavour thereof might not
be yielded to the most earnest adventurer were
couches not substituted for stiff, ungainly
chairs. By many a lesser trifle has digestion
been, if not ruined, influenced for ill.</p>

<p>But the classic experiment, if repeated too
often, might seem very odious. The modern
<i>gourmand</i>, or artist, is a romanticist, whether he
will or no. No screaming red waistcoat marks
the romantic movement in the kitchen, and yet
there it has been stronger even than in art and
literature. The picturesque must be had at
any cost. Simplicity is not spurned, far from
it; but it must be seasoned with becoming
sprinkling of romance. What could be simpler
than the common mushroom grilled, so self-sufficient
in its chaste severity that it allows
but salt and pepper and butter to approach it,
as it lies, fragrant and delicious, on its gridiron,
calling, like another St Lawrence, to be
turned when one side is fairly done. And yet
when, ready to be served, its rich brown beauty
is spread upon the paler brown of the toast, and
above rests butter's brilliant gold, have you not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
an arrangement as romantic in conception as
the "Ernani" of the master, or the pastoral of
Corot? Paltry meats and undesirable vegetables
should not be allowed to dispute supremacy
with it. Serve it alone, as you respect
yourself. Do not make your breakfast or dinner
table as preposterous a blunder as the modern
picture gallery.</p>

<p>Should simplicity pall upon you&mdash;and moments
there are when it cannot fail to pall&mdash;enrich
your grilled mushrooms with a sauce of
melted butter and onions and parsley, and a
single note of garlic, and the result will be
enchanting mushrooms <i>à la bourdelaise</i>. If <i>au
beurre</i> you would eat them, to accord with your
passing mood of suave serenity, stew them
gently and considerately in daintiest stew-pan
your kitchen can provide, and let cayenne and
powdered mace exult, as the romantic elements
of the stirring poem.</p>

<p>A still more poetic fancy may be met and
sweetly satisfied by <i>ragoût</i> of mushrooms. Listen
reverently, for it is food fit to be set before
the angels. Over the mushrooms, first boiled
on a quick fire, pour a gill of pure red wine&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the best Burgundy thus used will not be
wasted; then scatter spices, mace, and nutmeg,
with a discreet hand; boil once more; pour the
marvellous mixture upon five or six&mdash;or more,
if wanted&mdash;yolks of eggs, hard-boiled; garnish
the dish with grilled mushrooms, and bless the
day that you were born, predestined, as you
were, from all eternity for this one interval of
rapture.</p>

<p>Possibility of rapture there is likewise in a
white <i>fricassée</i> of mushrooms, which, if you have
your own happiness at heart, you cannot afford
to despise. Secure then, without delay&mdash;for
who would play fast and loose with happiness?&mdash;a
quart of fresh mushrooms. Clean them
with hands as tender as if bathing a new-born
babe. In three spoonfuls of water, and three of
milk, let them boil up three times. See that
temptation leads you not to violate the sanctity
of this thrice-three. Nutmeg, mace, butter, a
pint of rich thick cream alone, at this juncture,
will appease the saucepan's longings. Shake
well; and all the time, mind you. Be careful
there is no curdling, or else&mdash;damnation. The
masterpiece once triumphantly achieved and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
set upon a table covered with a fair white cloth,
great will be the rejoicing in the Earthly Paradise
of your dining-room.</p>

<p>Another sensation, another thrill awaits you
in mushrooms <i>au gratin</i>. Here, indeed, is romanticism
gone mad. Grated bacon, shallots,
a <i>bouquet garni</i>, mace, pepper and salt, eggs and
butter share the baking-dish with the mushrooms;
bread-crumbs complete the strange, subtle
combination, upon which you may break
your fast, dine, sup and sleep, as Valentine
upon the very naked name of love. A sorry
plight were yours if love, fickle and fading,
could be preferred to a dish of mushrooms fashioned
so fantastically.</p>

<p>"And oh! what lovely, beautiful eating there
is in this world!" It is Heine who said it&mdash;Heine
who, for a good dinner, would have
given twice the three hundred years of eternal
fame offered by Voltaire for a good digestion.
But lovely and beautiful are but feeble words
when it is a question of the mess of mushrooms,
for which who would not sacrifice eternal fame
for ever, in all cheerfulness and glee?</p>

<p>The reigning sultana in the mushroom's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
harem is the brilliant golden egg. Sweet symphonies
in brown and gold are the dishes their
union yields. <i>&OElig;ufs brouillés aux champignons</i>&mdash;has
not the very name a pretty sound? It is a
delight best suited to the midday breakfast;
a joyous course to follow the anchovy salad, the
eel well smoked, or whatever dainty <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i>
may stimulate to further appetite. The eggs,
scrambled and rivalling the buttercup's rich
gold, are laid delicately on crisp toast, and present
a couch, soft as down, for a layer of mushrooms.
Let Ruskin rave of Turner's sunsets,
let the glory of the Venetians be a delight
among art critics; but when did Turner or Titian
or Tintoret invent a finer scheme of colour
than egg and mushroom thus combined for the
greater happiness of the few? A silver dish or
one of rarest porcelain should be frame for a
picture so perfect.</p>

<p>Borrow a hint from the Hungarians, and vary
the arrangement to your own profit. Make a
<i>purée</i> of the mushrooms, as rich as cream permits,
and offer it as foundation for eggs poached
deftly and swiftly: a harmony in soft dove-like
greys and pale yellow, the result. It is an admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
contrivance, a credit to Szomorodni-drinking
Magyars. And there is no known reason
why it should not be eaten on Thames side
as on the banks of the Danube. Szomorodni,
in its native splendour, alas! is not to be had in
London town. But, without sacrilege, Chablis
or Graves, or Sauterne may take its place. To
drink red wine would be to strike a false note
in the harmony.</p>

<p>Another day, another dish, which you cannot
do better than make <i>omelette aux champignons</i>.
And if you will, you may eat it even as it was
prepared for Royal Stuarts by Master Cook
Rose, who wrote almost as prettily as he
cooked. Thus:&mdash;"Stove your champignons between
two dishes, season them with salt, pepper,
and nutmeg, then make an omelette with
a dozen of eggs, and when he is ready cover
him over with your champignons, and fold
him up, triangle-wise, and serve him with the
juice of lemons over him." A royal dish,
indeed.</p>

<p>Creatures of infinite resources, eggs and
mushrooms meet in cases to produce a new and
distinct joy. The mushrooms, stewed in milk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
thickened with the yolks of raw eggs and bread-crumbs,
line the little fluted china cases; into
each a fresh egg is broken; then more mushrooms
and bread-crumbs are spread gently
above; a shallow pan, its bottom just covered
with hot water, receives the cases, and ten minutes
in the oven will complete a triumph which,
once tasted, you may well remember all the
days of your life.</p>

<p>The kidney is loved by the mushroom scarce
less tenderly than the egg. <i>Rognons aux champignons</i>,
fragrant rich, ravishing, may also be
claimed by the happy midday hour. And like
so many a noble dish, it lavishes upon you the
pleasures of anticipation. For the kidneys, cut
in slices and laid in thickened gravy, must stew
slowly, slowly&mdash;never boiling, unless you would
have them vie with leather in consistency. At
an early stage the mushrooms, also in pieces,
may be added, and pepper and salt according to
inclination. And slowly, slowly let the stewing
continue. At the last supreme moment
pour in a glass of generous red wine, or if it
please you more, Marsala, and serve without
delay. Chambertin, or Nuits, at peace in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
cradle, is surely the wine decreed by fate to
drink with so sublime a creation.</p>

<p>With the tender <i>filet</i>, mushrooms prove irresistible;
with the graceful cutlet they seem so
ravishing that even <i>sauce Soubise</i>, the once inseparable,
may for the moment be easily forgotten.
And veal is no less susceptible to its
charms: let <i>noisettes de veau aux champignons</i> be
the <i>entrée</i> of to-morrow's dinner, and you will
return thanks to your deliverer from the roast!</p>

<p>As sauce, mushroom is the chosen one of fowl
and fish alike. Join your mushrooms to <i>Béchamel</i>,
one of the great mother sauces, and you will
have the wonder that Carême, its creator, served
first to the Princesse de B. How resist so aristocratic
a precedent? <i>Grasse</i>, or <i>maigre</i>, you can
make it, as the season demands. Or to a like
end you may devote that other marvel, <i>purée de
champignons à la Laguipierre</i>, whose patron was
the great Louis de Rohan, and into whose mysteries
Carême was initiated by the "Grand
M. Dunan." Ham, tomato, nutmeg, pepper,
lemon juice, are the chief ingredients that enter
into its composition. Who, after testing it, will
dare find naught but vexation and vanity in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
reign of the Sixteenth Louis? Subtle variation
may be had by substituting as foundation, <i>sauce
à la régence</i> or <i>sauce à la princesse</i> for <i>sauce Béchamel</i>;
while a sensation apart springs from the
lofty alliance between oysters and mushrooms.</p>

<p>How natural that for masterpieces in mushrooms
royalty so often has stood sponsor! Upon
the Prince of Wurtemberg rests the glorious responsibility
of Seine shad <i>à la purée de champignons</i>.
If history records not his name, a prince&mdash;in
spirit at least&mdash;must also have been the
first happy man to eat red mullets <i>aux champignons</i>,
or eels <i>aux huîtres et aux champignons</i>; show
yourself as princely before you are a week older.
While a king was he who first smiled upon
that kingly <i>ragoût</i> of mushrooms, mussels, and
shrimps. Be you a king in your turn&mdash;there
are few pleasures equal to it.</p>

<p>"For white fowls of all sort," Mrs Glasse recommends
her mushroom sauce, thus giving
loose reins to the artist's fancy. The fowl may
be boiled, and then rich with cream must be
the sauce that redeems it from insipidity. It
may be roasted, and then let the mushrooms be
somewhat more in evidence. Or it may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
broiled, and then mayhap it would be wise to
grill the mushrooms whole, instead of converting
them into sauce. Or&mdash;here is another suggestion,
and be thankful for it&mdash;mince your
chicken, which toast will receive gladly as a
covering and set upon it, as already upon <i>&oelig;ufs
brouillés</i>, the mushrooms grilled in butter. Long
might you live, far might you wander, before
chancing upon another delicacy so worthy.
Though, truth to tell&mdash;and where gastronomy
is the subject it is always best to be honest&mdash;<i>croquettes
de poulet aux champignons</i> seem well-nigh
worthier. If you would decide for yourself, try
both, and joy go with you in the trying.</p>

<p>An afterthought: dress livers with mushroom
sauce, and this is the manner in which it should
be done. "Take some pickled or fresh mushrooms,
cut small&mdash;both if you have them&mdash;and
let the livers be bruised fine, with a good deal
of parsley chopped small, a spoonful or two of
catchup, a glass of white wine, and as much
good gravy as will make sauce enough; thicken
it with a piece of butter rolled in flour. This
does for either roast or boiled."</p>

<p>For the rest, how count the innumerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
ways in which the mushroom adds to the gaiety
of the gourmand? What would the <i>vol-au-vent</i>
be without it? What the "Fine Pye," made
otherwise of carps and artichokes and crayfishes'
feet and lobster claws and nutmeg and
cloves alone? What, according to the "Complete
Court Cook," so proper for the second
course as the patty all of mushrooms? What
garniture fairer for "ragoo" or <i>fricassée</i>, according
to the same authority, than mushroom <i>farcis</i>?
But, however they may be served and
eaten, mushrooms you must make yours at any
cost. To say that you do not like them is confession
of your own philistinism. Learn to like
them; <i>will</i> to like them, or else your sojourn on
this earth will be a wretched waste. You will
have lived your life in vain if, at its close, you
have missed one of its finest emotions.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE INCOMPARABLE ONION</h2>

<p>Too often the poet sees but the tears that live
in an onion; not the smiles. And yet the
smiles are there, broad and genial, or subtle
and tender. "Rose among roots," its very
name revives memories of pleasant feasting; its
fragrance is rich forecast of delights to come.
Without it, there would be no gastronomic art.
Banish it from the kitchen, and all pleasure of
eating flies with it. Its presence lends colour
and enchantment to the most modest dish; its
absence reduces the rarest dainty to hopeless
insipidity, and the diner to despair.</p>

<p>The secret of good cooking lies in the discreet
and sympathetic treatment of the onion.
For what culinary masterpiece is there that
may not be improved by it? It gives vivacity
to soup, life to sauce; it is the "poetic soul" of
the salad bowl; the touch of romance in the
well-cooked vegetable. To it, sturdiest joint
and lightest stew, crisp rissole and stimulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
stuffing look for inspiration and charm&mdash;and
never are they disappointed! But woe betide
the unwary woman who would approach it for
sacrilegious ends. If life holds nothing better
than the onion in the right hand, it offers nothing
sadder and more degrading than the onion
brutalised. Wide is the gulf fixed between the
delicate sauce of a Prince de Soubise, and the
coarse, unsavoury sausage and onion mess of
the Strand. Let the perfection of the first be
your ideal; the horrid coarseness of the latter
shun as you would the devil.</p>

<p>The fragrance of this "wine-scented" esculent
not only whets the appetite; it abounds in
associations glad and picturesque. All Italy
is in the fine, penetrating smell; and all Provence;
and all Spain. An onion or garlic-scented
atmosphere hovers alike over the narrow
<i>calli</i> of Venice, the cool courts of Cordova,
and the thronged amphitheatre of Arles. It is
only the atmosphere breathed by the Latin peoples
of the South, so that ever must it suggest
blue skies and endless sunshine, cypress groves
and olive orchards. For the traveller it is interwoven
with memories of the golden canvases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of Titian, the song of Dante, the music of Mascagni.
The violet may not work a sweeter
spell, nor the carnation yield a more intoxicating
perfume.</p>

<p>And some men there have been in the past to
rank the onion as a root sacred to Aphrodite:
food for lovers. To the poetry of it none but
the dull and brutal can long remain indifferent.</p>

<p>Needless, then, to dwell upon its more prosaic
side: upon its power as a tonic, its value as a
medicine. Medicinal properties it has, as the
drunkard knows full well. But why consider
the drunkard? Leave him to the tender mercies
of the doctor. <i>Gourmandise</i>, or the love of
good eating, here the one and only concern, is
opposed to excess. "Every man who eats to
indigestion, or makes himself drunk, runs
the risk of being erased from the list of its
votaries."</p>

<p>The onion is but the name for a large family,
of which shallots, garlic, and chives are chief
and most honoured varieties. Moreover,
country and climate work upon it changes many
and strange. In the south it becomes larger and
more opulent, like the women. And yet, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
increases in size, it loses in strength&mdash;who shall
say why? And the loss truly is an improvement.
Our own onion often is strong even
unto rankness. Therefore, as all good housewives
understand, the Spanish species for most
purposes may be used instead, and great will be
the gain thereby. Still further south, still
further east, you will journey but to find the
onion fainter in flavour, until in India it seems
but a pale parody of its English prototype.
And again, at different seasons, very different
are its most salient qualities. In great gladness
of heart everyone must look forward to the
dainty little spring onion: adorable as vegetable
cooked in good white sauce, inscrutable as
guardian spirit of fresh green salad, irreproachable
as pickle in vinegar and mustard.</p>

<p>Garlic is one of the most gracious gifts of the
gods to men&mdash;a gift, alas! too frequently
abused. In the vegetable world, it has something
of the value of scarlet among colours, of
the clarionet's call in music. Brazen, and
crude, and screaming, when dragged into undue
prominence, it may yet be made to harmonise
divinely with fish and fowl, with meat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and other greens. Thrown wholesale into a
salad, it is odious and insupportable; but used
to rub the salad bowl, and then cast aside, its
virtue may not be exaggerated. For it, as for
lovers, the season of seasons is the happy spring
time. Its true home is Provence. What would
be the land of the troubadour and the Félibre
without the <i>ail</i> that festoons every greengrocer's
shop, that adorns every dish at every banquet
of rich and poor alike? As well rid <i>bouillabaisse</i>
of its saffron as of its <i>ail</i>; as well forget
the <i>pomme d'amour</i> in the sauce for <i>macaroni</i>, or
the rosemary and the thyme on the spit with
the little birds. The verse of Roumanille and
Mistral smells sweet of <i>ail</i>; Tartarin and Numa
Roumestan are heroes nourished upon it. It is
the very essence of <i>farandoles</i> and <i>ferrades</i>, of
bull-fights and water tournaments. A pinch
of <i>ail</i>, a <i>coup de vin</i>, and then&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Viva la joia,</div>
<div class="line">Fidon la tristessa!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And all the while we, in the cold, gloomy north,
eat garlic and are hated for it by friends and
foes. Only in the hot south can life <i>ail</i>-inspired
pass for a <i>galejado</i> or jest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
To the onion, the shallot is as the sketch to
the finished picture; slighter, it may be; but
often subtler and more suggestive. Unrivalled
in salads and sauces, it is without compare in
the sumptuous seasoning of the most fantastic
viands. It does not assert itself with the fury
and pertinacity of garlic; it does not announce
its presence with the self-consciousness of the
onion. It appeals by more refined devices, by
gentler means, and is to be prized accordingly.
Small and brown, it is pleasant to look upon as
the humble wild rose by the side of the <i>Gloire
de Dijon</i>. And, though it never attain to the
untempered voluptuousness of the onion, it
develops its sweetness and strength under
the hottest suns of summer: in July, August,
and September, does it mature; then do
its charms ripen; then may it be enjoyed in
full perfection, and satisfy the most riotous
gluttony.</p>

<p>Shallots for summer by preference, but chives
for spring: the delicate chives, the long, slim
leaves, fair to look upon, sweet to smell,
sweeter still to eat in crisp green salad. The
name is a little poem; the thing itself falls not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
far short of the divine. Other varieties there
be, other offshoots of the great onion&mdash;mother
of all; none, however, of greater repute, of
wider possibilities than these. To know them
well is to master the fundamental principles of
the art of cookery. But this is knowledge
given unto the few; the many, no doubt, will
remain for ever in the outer darkness, where
the onion is condemned to everlasting companionship
with the sausage&mdash;not altogether their
fault, perhaps. In cookery, as in all else, too
often the blind do lead the blind. But a few
years since and a "delicate diner," an authority
unto himself at least, produced upon the art of
dining a book, not without reputation. But to
turn to its index is to find not one reference to
the onion: all the poetry gone; little but prose
left! And this from an authority!</p>

<p>The onion, as a dish, is excellent; as seasoning
it has still more pleasant and commodious
merits. The modern <i>chef</i> uses it chiefly to season;
the ancient <i>cordon bleu</i> set his wits to work
to discover spices and aromatic ingredients
wherewith to season it. Thus, according to
Philemon,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">If you want an onion, just consider</div>
<div class="line">What great expense it takes to make it good;</div>
<div class="line">You must have cheese, and honey, and sesame,</div>
<div class="line">Oil, leeks, and vinegar, and assaf&oelig;tida,</div>
<div class="line">To dress it up with; for by itself the onion</div>
<div class="line">Is bitter and unpleasant to the taste.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A pretty mess, indeed; and who is there brave
enough to-day to test it? Honey and onion! it
suggests the ingenious contrivances of the mediæval
kitchen. The most daring experiment
now would be a dash of wine, red or white, a
suspicion of mustard, a touch of tomato in the
sauce for onions, stewed or boiled, baked or
stuffed. To venture upon further flights of
fancy the average cook would consider indiscreet,
though to the genius all things are possible.
However, its talents for giving savour
and character to other dishes is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>There is no desire more natural than that of
knowledge; there is no knowledge nobler than
that of the "gullet-science." "The discovery
of a new dish does more for the happiness of
the human race than the discovery of a planet!"
What would be Talleyrand's record but for that
moment of inspiration when, into the mysteries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of Parmesan with soup, he initiated his countrymen?
To what purpose the Crusades, had
Crusaders not seen and loved the garlic on
the plains of Askalon, and brought it home
with them, their one glorious trophy. To a
pudding Richelieu gave his name; the Prince
de Soubise lent his to a sauce, and thereby won
for it immortality.</p>

<p>A benefactor to his race indeed he was:
worthy of a shrine in the Temple of Humanity.
For, plucking the soul from the onion, he laid
bare its hidden and sweetest treasure to the
elect. Scarce a sauce is served that owes not
fragrance and flavour to the wine-scented root;
to it, <i>Béarnaise</i>, <i>Maître d'Hôtel</i>, <i>Espagnole</i>, <i>Italienne</i>,
<i>Béchamel</i>, <i>Provençale</i>, and who shall say
how many more? look for the last supreme
touch that redeems them from insipid commonplace.
But <i>Sauce Soubise</i> is the very idealisation
of the onion, its very essence; at once delicate
and strong; at once as simple and as perfect
as all great works of art.</p>

<p>The plodding painter looks upon a nocturne
by Whistler, and thinks how easy, how preposterously easy!
A touch here, a stroke there, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the thing is done. But let him try! And so
with <i>Sauce Soubise</i>. Turn to the first cookery
book at hand, and read the <i>recipe</i>. "Peel four
large onions and cut them into thin slices;
sprinkle a little pepper and salt upon them,
together with a small quantity of nutmeg; put
them into a saucepan with a slice of fresh butter,
and steam gently"&mdash;let them smile, the true
artist would say&mdash;"till they are soft." But why
go on with elaborate directions? Why describe
the exact quantity of flour, the size of the potato,
the proportions of milk and cream to be
added? Why explain in detail the process of
rubbing through a sieve? In telling or the
reading these matters seem not above the intelligence
of a little child. But in the actual
making, only the artist understands the secret
of perfection, and his understanding is born
within him, not borrowed from dry statistics
and formal tables. He may safely be left to
vary his methods; he may add sugar, he may
omit nutmeg; he may fry the onions instead of
boiling, for love of the tinge of brown, rich
and sombre, thus obtained. But, whatever he
does, always with a wooden spoon will he stir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
his savoury mixture; always, as result, produce
a godlike sauce which the mutton cutlets of
Paradise, vying with Heine's roast goose, will
offer of their own accord at celestial banquets.
What wonder that a certain famous French
count despised the prosaic politician who had
never heard of cutlets <i>à la Soubise</i>?</p>

<p>However, not alone in sauce can the condescending
onion come to the aid of dull, substantial
flesh and fowl. Its virtue, when joined to
sage in stuffing, who will gainsay? Even chestnuts,
destined to stuff to repletion the yawning
turkey, cannot afford to ignore the insinuating
shallot or bolder garlic; while no meat comes
into the market that will not prove the better
and the sweeter for at least a suspicion of onion
or of <i>ail</i>. A barbarian truly is the cook who
flings a mass of fried onions upon the tender
steak, and then thinks to offer you a rare and
dainty dish. Not with such wholesale brutality
can the ideal be attained. The French chef
has more tact. He will take his <i>gigot</i> and sympathetically
prick it here and there with garlic
or with chives, even as it is roasting; and whoever
has never tasted mutton thus prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
knows not the sublimest heights of human happiness.
Or else he will make a <i>bouquet garni</i> of
his own, entirely of these aromatic roots and
leaves, and fasten it in dainty fashion to the
joint; pleasure is doubled when he forgets to
remove it, and the meat is placed upon the
table, still bearing its delicious decoration.
Moods there be that call for stronger effects:
moods when the blazing poppy field of a Monet
pleases more than the quiet moonlight of a
Cazin; when Tennyson is put aside for Swinburne.
At such times, call for a shoulder of
mutton, well stuffed with onions, and still further
satiate your keen, vigorous appetite with
a bottle of Beaune or Pomard. But here, a
warning: eat and drink with at least a pretence
of moderation. Remember that, but for an excess
of shoulder of mutton and onions, Napoleon
might not have been defeated at Leipzig.</p>

<p>But at all times, and in all places, onions
clamour for moderation. A salad of tomatoes
buried under thick layers of this powerful esculent
must disgust; gently sprinkled with
chopped-up chives or shallots, it enraptures.
Potatoes <i>à la Lyonnaise</i>, curried eggs, Irish stew,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
<i>Gulyas</i>, <i>ragoût</i>, alike demand restraint in their
preparation, a sweet reasonableness in the
hand that distributes the onion.</p>

<p>For the delicate diner, as for the drunkard,
onion soup has charm. It is of the nature of
<i>sauce Soubise</i>, and what mightier recommendation
could be given it? Thus Dumas, the
high priest of the kitchen, made it: a dozen
onions&mdash;Spanish by preference&mdash;minced with
discretion, fried in freshest of fresh butter until
turned to a fair golden yellow, he boiled in
three pints or so of water, adequately seasoned
with salt and pepper; and then, at the end of
twenty full minutes, he mixed with this preparation
the yolks of two or three eggs, and
poured the exquisite liquid upon bread, cut and
ready. At the thought alone the mouth waters,
the eye brightens. The adventurous, now and
again, add ham or rice, vegetables or a <i>bouquet
garni</i>. But this as you will, according to the
passing hour's leisure. Only of one thing
make sure&mdash;in Dumas confidence is ever to be
placed without doubt or hesitation.</p>

<p>Dumas' soup for dinner; but for breakfast the
unrivalled omelette of Brillat-Savarin. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
made after this fashion: the roes of two carp,
a piece of fresh tunny, and shallots, well hashed
and mixed, are thrown into a saucepan with a
lump of butter beyond reproach, and whipped
up till the butter is melted, which, says the
great one, "constitutes the speciality of the
omelette;" in the meantime, let some one prepare,
upon an oval dish, a mixture of butter and
parsley, lemon juice, and chives&mdash;not shallots
here, let the careless note&mdash;the plate to be left
waiting over hot embers; next beat up twelve
eggs, pour in the roes and tunny, stir with the
zeal and sympathy of an artist, spread upon the
plate that waits so patiently, serve at once; and
words fail to describe the ecstasy that follows.
Especially, to quote again so eminent an authority,
let the omelette "be washed down with
some good old wine, and you will see wonders,"
undreamed of by haschish or opium eater.</p>

<p>When the little delicate spring onion is smelt
in the land, a shame, indeed, it would be to
waste its tender virginal freshness upon sauce
and soup. Rather refrain from touching it
with sharp knife or cruel chopper, but in its
graceful maiden form boil it, smother it in rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
pure cream, and serve it on toast, to the unspeakable
delectation of the devout. Life
yields few more precious moments. Until
spring comes, however, you may do worse than
apply the same treatment to the older onion.
In this case, as pleasure's crown of pleasure,
adorn the surface with grated Gruyère, and,
like the ancient hero, you will wish your throat
as long as a crane's neck, that so you might
the longer and more leisurely taste what you
swallow.</p>

<p>Onions <i>farcis</i> are beloved by the epicure. A
nobler dish could scarce be devised. You may
make your forcemeats of what you will, beef or
mutton, fowl or game; you may, an' you please,
add truffles, mushrooms, olives, and capers.
But know one thing; tasteless it will prove,
and lifeless, unless bacon lurk unseen somewhere
within its depths. Ham will answer in
a way, but never so well as humbler bacon.
The onion that lends itself most kindly to this
device is the Spanish.</p>

<p>One word more. As the <i>ite missa est</i> of the
discourse let this truth&mdash;a blessing in itself&mdash;be
spoken. As with meat, so with vegetables, few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
are not the better for the friendly companionship
of the onion, or one of its many offshoots.
Peas, beans, tomatoes, egg-plant are not indifferent
to its blandishments. If honour be paid
to the first pig that uprooted a truffle, what of
the first man who boiled an onion? And what
of the still mightier genius who first used it as
seasoning for his daily fare? Every <i>gourmet</i>
should rise up and call him blessed.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">THE TRIUMPHANT TOMATO</h2>

<p>The triumph of the tomato has given hungry
men and women a new lease of pleasure. Sad
and drear were the days when the <i>gourmet</i>
thought to feast, and the beautiful scarlet fruit
had no place upon his table. The ancient <i>chef</i>
knew it not, nor the mediæval artist who, even
without it, could create marvellous works the
modern may not hope to rival. Like so many
good things, it first saw the light in that happy
Western Continent where the canvas-back duck
makes its home and shad swim in fertile rivers.
What, indeed, was life, what the gift of eating,
before the Columbus of the kitchen had discovered
the tomato, the turkey, and the yellow
Indian corn? Reflect upon it, and be grateful
that you, at least, were not born in the Dark
Age of cookery!</p>

<p>Poor, stupid man! a treasure was presented
to him freely and generously, and he thrust it
from him. The tomato offered itself a willing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
sacrifice, and he scorned it, mistaking gold for
dross. The American&mdash;and long years in purgatory
will not redeem his fault&mdash;looked upon
it with suspicion. To-day, it is true, he honours
it aright: in the summer-time he bows
down before its gay freshness; in the winter he
cherishes it in tins. It has become as indispensable
to him as salt or butter. He values it at
its true worth. But still, half a century has
not passed since he doubted it, heaping insults
upon its trusting sweetness. He fancied poison
lurked within it. O the cruel fancy! There it
was, perfect and most desirable, and he, blind
fool, would not touch it until endless hours of
stewing had lessened, if not utterly destroyed,
its fresh young charms. And the Englishman
was no wiser. Within the last decade only has
he welcomed the stranger at his gates, and at
the best his welcome has been but halting and
half-hearted. The many continue obstinately
to despise it; the few have pledged their allegiance
with reservations. The Latin, and even
the wild Hun, were converted without a fear of
misgiving while the Anglo-Saxon faltered and
was weak. Many and beautiful are the strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
dishes the tomato adorns in Magyarland. Was
there ever a <i>menu</i> in sunny Italy that did not
include this meat or that vegetable <i>al pomodoro</i>?
The very Spaniard, whom rumour weds irrevocably
to garlic, nourishes a tender passion for
the voluptuous red fruit, and wins rapture from
it. And deep and true is the Provençal's love
for his <i>pomme d'amour</i>; is not the name a measure
of his affection? The Love Apple! Were
there, after all, tomatoes in Judea, and were
these the apples that comforted the love-sick
Shulamite?</p>

<p>Now that the tomato has forced universal
recognition; now that in England it lends glory
of colour to the greengrocer's display; now that
the hothouse defeats the cruel siege of the seasons,
and mild May, as well as mellow September,
yields apples of love, pause a moment,
turn from the trivial cares of life, to meditate
upon its manifold virtues.</p>

<p>The tomato as a vegetable should be the
first point of the meditation. Let us reflect.
Stewed, though not as in America of old, until
all flavour is lost, it has the merit of simplicity
by no means to be underestimated: drained of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the greater part of its juice, thickened slightly
with flour, it cannot disappoint. <i>Au gratin</i>, it
aspires to more delirious joys: the pleasure
yielded develops in proportion to the pains
taken to produce it. Into a baking dish olive
oil is poured in moderation; a sprinkling of
salt and pepper and fragrant herbs well powdered,
together with bread-crumbs duly grated,
follows; next the tomatoes, eager and blushing,
whole or in dainty halves, as the impulse of
the moment may prompt; more bread-crumbs
and pepper and salt and herbs must cover them
gently, more oil be poured upon the stirring
harmony; and an hour in the oven will turn
you out as pretty a side-dish as was ever devised
by ingenious Mrs Glasse, who&mdash;O the
pity of it&mdash;lived too soon for fond dalliance
with love's crowning vegetable.</p>

<p><i>Farcies</i> tomatoes may not easily be surpassed.
Upon your whim or choice it will depend whether
you stuff them whole, or cut them in half
for so ineffable a purpose. And upon your
whim likewise depends the special forcemeat
used. Chopped mushrooms, parsley and shallot,
seasoned with discretion, leave little to ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
for. Prepare, instead, sausage meat, garlic,
parsley, tarragon, and chives, and the tomatoes
so stuffed you may without pedantry call <i>à la
Grimod de la Reynière</i>. But whatever you call
them, count upon happiness in the eating.</p>

<p>Second point of the meditation: the tomato
as an auxiliary. If you have learned the trick
of association, at once you see before you a
steaming harmony in pale yellow and scarlet,
the long soft tubes of <i>macaroni</i> or <i>spaghetti</i> encompassed
round about by a deep stream of
tomatoes stewed and seasoned; at once you
feast upon <i>macaroni al pomodoro</i> and Chianti, and
Italy lies, like a map, before your mind's eye,
its towns and villages marked by this dish of
dishes. With rice, tomatoes are no less in
pleasant, peaceful unity; in stuffed <i>paprika</i>, or
pepper, they find their true affinity. Grilled,
they make a sympathetic garniture for <i>filet piqué
à la Richelieu</i>; stuffed, they are the proper accompaniment
of <i>tournedos à la Leslie</i>; neatly
halved, they serve as a foundation to soles <i>à la
Loie Fuller</i>. Chickens clamour for them as ally,
and so does the saltest of salt cod. In a word,
a new combination they might with ease provide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
for every day in the year. Enough will
have been said if this one truth is established:
there is scarce a fish or fowl, scarce any meat
or vegetable, that is not the better and the
nobler for the temporary union with the tomato.</p>

<p>And now, the third point of the meditation,
which, too often, escapes the prosaic, unmeditative
islander: the tomato as a dish for breakfast.
Only recently it was thus that two of
rare beauty and sweet savour fulfilled their destiny:
on a plate fashioned by barbarous potters
on the banks of the Danube, where the love-apple
grows in gay profusion, stretched a thin,
crisp slice of bacon decoratively streaked with
fat and grilled to a turn; it bore, as twin flowers,
the two tomatoes, also grilled, fragrant,
tender, delectable. Surely here was a poetic
prelude to the day's toil. To Belgium all
praise be given for teaching that, stewed and
encircling buttered or scrambled eggs, tomatoes
may again enliven the breakfast table, that bitter
test of conjugal devotion; to France, the
credit of spreading them at the bottom of plate
or dish as a bed for eggs artistically poached or
fried. History records the names of generals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and dates of battles, but what chronicler has
immortalised the genius who first enclosed tomatoes
in an omelet? This is a brutal, ungrateful
world we live in.</p>

<p>And now pass on to the fourth heading, and
new ecstasies: the tomato as salad. Remember
that the tomatoes must be deftly sliced in their
skins or else the juice escapes; that a touch of
onion or garlic is indispensable; that the dressing
must be of oil and vinegar, pepper and salt;
unless, of course, a <i>mayonnaise</i> be made. Another
weird salad there is with qualities to
endear it to the morbid and neurotic. Let it
be explained briefly, that lurid description may
not be thought to exaggerate lurid attraction:
drop your tomatoes, brilliantly red as the abhorred
Scarlet Woman, into hot water in order
to free them of their skins; place them whole,
and in passionate proximity, in a dish of silver
or delicate porcelain; smother them under a
thick layer of whipped cream. For the sake of
decoration and the unexpected, stick in here
and there a pistachio nut, and thank the gods
for the new sensation.</p>

<p>In soup, thin or clear, the tomato knows no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
rival; in sauce, it stands supreme, ranking
worthily with the four classical sauces of the
French <i>cuisine</i>. And here, a suggestion to be
received with loud, jubilant <i>Alleluias</i>! Follow
the example of Attila's heirs, and, as last touch,
pour cream upon your tomato sauce. He who
has known and eaten and loved <i>paprika gefüllte</i>
in the wilds of Transylvania, will bear willing
witness to the admirable nature of this expedient.</p>

<p>The more devout, the professed worshipper,
will eat his love-apple without artificial device
of cookery or dressing, with only salt for savour.
For this excess of devotion, however,
unqualified commendation would not be just.
Unadorned the tomato is not adorned the most.</p>

<p>But cook or serve it as you will, see that it
be eaten by you and yours&mdash;that is the main
thing. The tomatoes that make glad the heart
of the loiterer in Covent Garden are fresh as
the sweet breath of May.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">A DISH OF SUNSHINE</h2>

<p>"The weather is regarded as the very nadir
and scoff of conversational topics." How can
the ingenious housewife talk of aught else in
the Winter season? Not because, as Mr Stevenson
argues, "the dramatic element in scenery
is far more tractable in language, and far more
human both in import and suggestion, than the
stable features of the landscape," but because
upon it she is dependent for ease and success in
making her every luncheon and dinner a culinary
triumph.</p>

<p>Of what avail the morning's conference with
the greengrocer's boy, or even the conscientious
visit to the greengrocer's shop or the ramble
through the market&mdash;unless, perhaps, and happily,
her pockets be lined with gold, when hothouse
vegetables, and out-of-season delicacies,
must be paid for with the alacrity of a Cr&oelig;sus?
Otherwise, dark, hopeless despair seizes upon
her? Must she not brood in abject melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
when the hideous truth is revealed to her that
earth's resources are limited to turnip-tops and
Brussels sprouts, with, it may be, a few Jerusalem
artichokes thrown in? Celery, the
lordly, is frozen. Cauliflower, the fragrant,
frost-bitten irretrievably, will not yield to the
most urgent inducements of hot water. Lettuce
is a thing of the past and of the future.
Sad and drear indeed is the immediate prospect.
For surely turnip-tops are a delusion,
and against the monotony of sprouts the aspiring
soul rebels.</p>

<p>It is at this crisis that hope flames right in a
strangely neglected corner. Italian sunshine
and blue skies, concentrated in flour paste,
wrought into tubes and ribbons, squares and
lozenges, come to gladden the sinking heart
and cheer the drooping spirits. Why despair
when <i>macaroni</i> is always to be had, inestimable
as a vegetable, unrivalled as an <i>entrée</i>, a perfect
meal, if you choose, in itself?</p>

<p>Upon the imagination of those to whom food
is something besides a mere satisfaction to carnal
appetite, <i>macaroni</i> works a strange, subtle
spell. The very name conjures up sweet poetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
visions; it is the magic crystal or beryl stone,
in which may be seen known things, dear to
the memory: smiling valleys where the vines
are festooned, not as Virgil saw them, from
elm to elm, but from mulberry to mulberry;
and where the beautiful, broad-horned, white
oxen drag, in solemn dignity, the crawling
plough; olive-clad slopes and lonely stone
palms; the gleam of sunlit rivers winding with
the reeds and the tall, slim poplars; the friendly
wayside <i>trattoria</i> and the pleasant refrain of the
beaming <i>cameriere</i>, "<i>Subito Signora; ecco!</i>"&mdash;a
refrain ceaseless as the buzzing of bees among
the clover. In a dish of <i>macaroni</i> lies all Italy
for the woman with eyes to see or a heart to
feel.</p>

<p>Or visions more personal, more intimate, she
may summon for her own delight; the midday
halt and lunch in Castiglione del Lago on its
gentle hill-top, the blue of Thrasymene's lake
shining between the olives, and all fair to behold,
save the <i>padrone</i> with his conscienceless
charges for the bowl of <i>macaroni</i> that had been
so good in the eating. Or else, perhaps, the
evening meal in the long refectory at Monte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Oliveto, with the white-robed brothers; or,
again, the unforgettable breakfast at Pompeii's
<i>Albergo del Sole</i>, the good wine ranged upon the
old tree trunk that serves as central column,
the peacock, tail outspread, strutting about
among the chairs and tables, the overpowering
sweetness of the flowering bean stealing, from
near fields, through open doors and windows.
Or, still again, the thought of Pompeii sends
one off upon the journey from its ruined streets
to Naples&mdash;on one side the Bay, on the other
the uninterrupted line of villages, every low
white house adorned with garlands of <i>macaroni</i>
drying peacefully and swiftly in the hot sun.
And a few pence only will it cost to dream such
dreams of beauty and of gladness.</p>

<p>Many as are the devices for preparing this
stuff that dreams are made of, none can excel
the simplest of all. Eat it the way the Italian
loves it, and for yourself you open up new vistas
of pleasure. And what could be easier?
In water well salted&mdash;upon the salt much depends&mdash;the
<i>macaroni</i>, preferably in the large
generous tubes, is boiled for twenty minutes,
or half an hour, until it is as soft as soft may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
be without breaking. A capacious bowl, its
sides well buttered and sprinkled with grated
Parmesan cheese, must wait in readiness. Into
it put the <i>macaroni</i>, well drained of the water,
into its midst drop a large piece of sweet, fresh
butter, and sprinkle, without stint, more of the
indispensable Parmesan; mix wisely and with
discrimination; and then eat to your soul's, or
stomach's, content. To further your joy, have
at your side a flash of Chianti, pure and strong,
standing in no need of baptism. The gods
never fared better. But, one word of advice:
if this dish you serve for luncheon, defy
convention, and make it the first and last
and only course. It may seem meagre in
the telling. But to treat it with due respect
and justice much must be eaten, and this
much makes more impossible even to the
hopeful.</p>

<p>Another word of advice: never break or cut
the <i>macaroni</i> into small pieces; the cook who
dares to disobey in this particular deserves instant
and peremptory dismissal. Where is the
poetry, where the art, if it can be eaten with as
little trouble and planning as an everyday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
potato, or a mess of greens? Who, that has
seen, can forget the skilful Italian winding the
long steaming tubes around and around his
fork, his whole soul and intelligence concentrated
upon the pretty feat of transposing these
tubes from his fork to his mouth. It is difficult;
yes, especially for the foreigner; but where is
the pleasure without pain? As well tear your
Troyon or your Diaz into shreds, and enjoy it
in bits, as violate the virginal lengths of your
<i>macaroni</i>.</p>

<p>In more lavish mood, prepare it <i>al sugo</i>, and
no cause need you fear for regret. It is well-nigh
as simple; the <i>macaroni</i>, or better still
<i>spaghetti</i>, the smaller, daintier variety, once
boiled, is taken from the water only to be
plunged in rich gravy, its quantity varying
according to the quantity of <i>spaghetti</i> used; let
it boil anew, or rather simmer, until each long
tube is well saturated; then, add the cheese
and butter, and say your <i>Benedicite</i> with a full
heart.</p>

<p>Or, would you have it richer still, and so
tempt Providence? Make tomato the foundation
of the gravy, spice it with cloves, bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
out the sweet <i>bouquet garni</i>, serve with butter
and Parmesan cheese as before, and call the
result <i>Macaroni à la Napolitaine</i>. <i>Spaghetti</i>, here
again, will answer the purpose as well, nor
will the pretty, flat, wavy ribbon species come
amiss. To court perfection, rely upon mushrooms
for one of the chief elements in this
adorable concoction, and the whole world over
you may travel without finding a dish worthy
to compete with it. <i>Macaroni</i> can yield nothing
more exquisite, though not yet are its resources
exhausted.</p>

<p><i>Au gratin</i> it is also to be commended. The
preliminary boiling may now, as always, be
taken for granted. With its chosen and well-tried
accompaniments of butter and Parmesan
cheese, and steeped in a good white sauce, it
may simmer gently over the fire until the sympathetic
butter be absorbed; then in a decently
prepared dish, and covered with bread-crumbs,
it should bake until it is warmed into a golden-brown
harmony that enraptures the eye. Or
with stronger seasoning, with onion and pepper
and cayenne, you may create a savoury beyond
compare. Or combined with the same ingredients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
you may stew your <i>macaroni</i> in milk, and
revel in <i>macaroni sauté</i>; worse a hundred times,
truly, might you fare.</p>

<p>But, if you would be wholly reckless, why,
then try <i>Macaroni à la Pontife</i>, and know that
human ambition may scarce pretend to nobler
achievements. For a mould of goodly proportions
you fill with <i>macaroni</i> and forcemeat of
fowl and larks and bits of bacon and mushrooms
and game filleted; and this ineffable
arrangement you moisten with gravy and allow
to simmer slowly, as befits its importance, for
an hour; eat it, and at last you too, with Faust,
may hail the fleeting moment, and bid it stay,
because it is so fair!</p>

<p>In puddings and pies <i>macaroni</i> is most excellent.
But if you be not lost beyond redemption,
never sweeten either one or the other; the
suggestion of such sacrilege alone is horrid.
Into little croquettes it may by cunning hands
be modelled; <i>en timbale</i>, in well-shaped mould,
it reveals new and welcome possibilities. With
fish it assimilates admirably; in soup it is
above criticism. It will strengthen the flavour
of chestnuts, nor will it disdain the stimulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
influence of wine, white or red. And in the
guise of <i>nouilles</i>, or nudels, it may be stuffed
with forcemeat of fowl or beef, and so clamour
for the rich tomato sauce.</p>

<h2 class="p4">ON SALADS</h2>

<p>To speak of salads in aught but the most
reverential spirit were sacrilege. To be honoured
aright, they should be eaten only in the
company of the devout or in complete solitude&mdash;and
perhaps this latter is the wiser plan.

<p>Over your hot meats you cannot linger; if
alone with them, and read you must, a common
newspaper, opened at the day's despatches,
best serves your purpose; else, your gravies
and sauces congeal into a horrid white mess
upon your plate, and tepid is every unsavoury
morsel your fork carries to your mouth. But
over any one of the "salad clan"&mdash;lettuce or
tomato, beans or potato, as fancy prompts&mdash;you
can revel at leisure in your Balzac, your Heine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
your Montaigne, which, surely, it would be
desecration to spread open by the side of the
steaming roast or the prosaic bacon and eggs.
There has always seemed one thing lacking in
Omar's Paradise: a salad, he should have bargained
for with his Book of Verses, his Jug of
Wine, and Loaf of Bread "underneath the
Bough."</p>

<p>Far behind has the Continent left Great
Britain in the matter of salads. To eat them
in perfection you must cross the Channel&mdash;as,
indeed, you must in the pursuit of all the daintiest
dishes&mdash;and travel still farther than France.
The French will give you for breakfast a bowl
of <i>Soissons</i>, for dinner a <i>Romaine</i>, which long
survive as tender memories; even the humble
dandelion they have enlisted in the good cause.
With the Italian you will fare no less well; better
it may be, for, with the poetic feeling that
has disappeared for ever from their art and
architecture, they fill the salad bowl at times
with such delicate conceits as tender young
violet leaves, so that you may smell the spring
in the blossoms at your throat, while you devour
it in the greens set before you. But in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Germany, though there may be less play of
fancy in the choice of materials, there is far
greater poetry in the mixing of them. As an
atonement for that offence against civilisation,
the midday dinner, the Germans have invented
a late supper that defies the critic: the very
meanest <i>Speise-Saal</i> is transfigured when the
gaslight falls softly on the delicious potato or
cucumber or herring salads of the country,
flanked by the tall slim glasses of amber Rhenish
wine. But, excelling Germany, even as
Germany excels France, Hungary is the true
home of the salad. It would take a book to
exhaust the praise it there inspires. To die
eating salad on the banks of the Danube to
the wail of the Czardas&mdash;that would be the
true death! What, however, save the ideals
realised, is to be effected in a land where
tomatoes are as plentiful as are potatoes in
Ireland?</p>

<p>The Briton, it must be admitted, has of late
progressed. Gone is the time when his favourite
salad was a horror unspeakable: an onion
and a lettuce served whole, chopped up by
himself, smothered in salt and pepper, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
fairly sluiced with vinegar. To understand
the full iniquity of it, you must remember what
an excess of vinegar the stalwart Briton was
equal to in those days, now happily past. An
imperial pint, Mr Weller's friend, the coachman
with the hoarse voice, took with his oysters
without betraying the least emotion. As
benighted, smacking no less of the Dark Ages,
is the custom of serving with cheese a lettuce
(of the long crisp species known as <i>cos</i> in the
cookery books), cut ruthlessly in halves. You
are supposed to dip the leaves into salt, and
afterwards return thanks with a grateful heart.
Many there are who will still eat lettuce in this
fashion with their tea; the curious student of
evolution can point to it as a survival of the
old barbarism; to the mustard and cress or cucumber
sandwiches which have replaced it, as
a higher phase of development.</p>

<p>But, though these sorry customs still survive
here and there, even as superstitions linger
among ignorant peasants, British eyes are opening
to the truth. The coming of the salad in
England marks the passing of the Englishman
from barbarous depth to civilised heights. Has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
he not exchanged his old-love Frith for Whistler,
and has he not risen from G. P. R. James
to George Meredith? Not a whit less important
in the history of his civilisation is his
emancipation from that vile, vinegar-drenched
abomination to the succulent tomato, the unrivalled
potato, well "fatigued" in the "capacious
salad-bowl."</p>

<p>Of every woman worthy of the name, it is the
duty to master the secret of the perfect salad,
and to prepare it for her own&mdash;and man's&mdash;greater
comfort and joy in this life, and&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;salvation in the next. This secret is
all in the dressing. It is easy enough to buy
in the market, or order at the greengrocer's a
lettuce, or a cucumber, or a pound of tomatoes.
But to make of them a masterpiece, there's the
rub. Upon the dressing and "fatiguing" success
depends. The mission of the lettuce, the
resources of the bean were undreamed of until
the first woman&mdash;it must have been a woman!&mdash;divined
the virtue that lies in the harmonious
combination of oil and vinegar. Vinegar alone
and undiluted is for the vulgar; mixed with oil
it as much surpasses nectar and ambrosia as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
these hitherto have been reckoned superior to
the liquors of mere human brewing. Of <i>mayonnaise</i>
nothing need as yet be said; it ranks rather
with sauces, irreproachable when poured upon
salmon, or chicken, or lobster&mdash;upon the simpler
and more delicate salads it seems well-nigh
too strong and coarse. The one legitimate
dressing in these cases is made of vinegar
and oil, pepper and salt, and, on certain rare
occasions, mustard.</p>

<p>As with sauces, it is simple to put down in
black and white the several ingredients of the
good dressing. But what of the proportions?
What of the methods of mixing? In the large
towns of the United States where men and
women delight in the pleasures of the table,
are specialists who spend their afternoons going
from house to house, preparing the salads for
the day's coming great event. And perhaps,
in the end, all mankind may see advantages in
this division of labour. For only the genius
born can mix a salad dressing as it should be
mixed. Quantities of pepper and salt, of oil
and vinegar for him (or her) are not measured
by rule or recipe, but by inspiration. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
may generalise and insist upon one spoonful of
oil for every guest and one for the bowl&mdash;somewhat
in the manner of tea-making&mdash;and then
one-third the quantity of vinegar. But out of
these proportions the Philistine will evolve for
you a nauseating concoction; the initiated, a
dressing of transcendental merit.</p>

<p>As much depends upon the mixing as upon
the proportions. The foolish pour in first their
oil, then their vinegar, and leave the rest to
chance, with results one shudders to remember.
The two must be mixed together even as they
are poured over the salad, and here the task but
begins. For next, they must be mixed with
the salad. To "fatigue" it the French call this
special part of the process, and indeed, to create
a work of art, you must mix and mix and
mix until you are fatigued yourself, and your
tomatoes or potatoes reduced to one-half their
original bulk. Then will the dressing have
soaked through and through them, then will
every mouthful be a special plea for gluttony,
an eloquent argument for the one vice that
need not pall with years.</p>

<p>One other ingredient must not be omitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
here, since it is as essential as the oil itself.
This is the onion&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Rose among roots, the maiden fair,</div>
<div class="line">Wine-scented and poetic soul</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>of every salad. You may rub with it the bowl,
you may chop it up fine and sprinkle with it
the lettuce, as you might sprinkle an omelet
with herbs. But there, in one form or another,
it must be. The French have a tendency to
abuse it; they will cut it in great slices to
spread between layers of tomatoes or cucumbers.
But there is a touch of grossness in this
device. It is just the <i>soupçon</i> you crave, just the
subtle flavour it alone can impart. You do not
want your salad, when it comes on the table, to
suggest nothing so much as the stewed steak
and onions shops in the Strand! The fates
forbid.</p>

<p>"What diversities soever there be in herbs,
all are shuffled up together under the name of
sallade." And Montaigne wrote in sadness,
knowing well that there could be no error more
fatal. Have you ever asked for a salad at the
greengrocer's, and been offered a collection of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
weeds befitting nothing so much as Betsy
Prig's capacious pocket? Have you ever, at
the table of the indifferent, been served with
the same collection plentifully drenched with
"salad cream"? But these are painful memories,
speedily to be put aside and banished for
evermore. Some combinations there are of
herbs or greens or vegetables unspeakably delicious,
even in the thought thereof. But it is
not at haphazard, by an unsympathetic greengrocer,
they can be made; not in haste, from
bottles of atrocities, they can be dressed.
They are the result of conscientious study, of
consummate art.</p>

<p>Besides, some varieties there be of flavour
too delicate to be tampered with: for instance,
the cabbage lettuce, as the vulgar call it, which
comes in about Easter time, but which, at the
cost of a little trouble, can be had all the year
round. For some reason unknown, your hard-hearted
greengrocer, half the time, objects to
it seriously, declares it not to be found from
end to end of Covent Garden. But let him
understand that upon his providing it depends
your custom, and he fetches it&mdash;the unprincipled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
one&mdash;fast enough. The ragged outer
leaves pulled away, crisp and fresh is the heart,
a cool green and white harmony not to be
touched by brutal knife. The leaves must be
torn apart, gently and lovingly, as the painter
plays with the colours on his palette. Then,
thrown into the bowl which already has been
well rubbed with onion, and slices of hard-boiled
egg laid upon the top for adornment and
flavouring alike, at once may the dressing of
oil and vinegar and salt and pepper be poured
on, and the process of "fatiguing" begin. You
need add nothing more, to know, as you eat,
that life, so long as salads are left to us, is well
worth the living.</p>

<p>To say this is to differ in a measure from the
great Alexandre, a misfortune surely to be
avoided. To this lettuce he would add herbs
of every kind; nay, even oysters, or tortoise
eggs, or anchovies, or olives&mdash;in fact, the subject
is one which has sent his ever delightful
imagination to work most riotously. But, in
all humility, must it still be urged that the
cabbage lettuce is best ungarnished, save, it
may be, by a touch of the unrivalled celery or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
slices of the adorable tomato&mdash;never, if yours
be the heart of an artist, by the smallest fragment
of the coarse, crude, stupid beetroot.</p>

<p>The <i>romaine</i>, or <i>cos</i>, however, is none the
worse for Dumas' suggestions; indeed, it is
much the better. Its long stiff leaves, as they
are, may not be "fatigued" with anything approaching
ease or success. It is to be said&mdash;with
hesitation perhaps, and yet to be said&mdash;that
they make the better salad for being cut
before they are put into the bowl. As if to
atone for this unavoidable liberty, dainty additions
may not come amiss: the tender little
boneless anchovies, fish of almost any and every
kind&mdash;most admirably, salmon and a bit of red
herring in conjunction&mdash;cucumbers, celery, tomatoes,
radishes&mdash;all will blend well and harmoniously.
Be bold in your experiments, and
fear nothing. Many failures are a paltry price
to pay for one perfect dish.</p>

<p>Of other green salads the name is legion:
endive, dandelion leaves, chicory, chervil, mustard
and cress, and a hundred and more besides
before the resources of France&mdash;more especially
the Midi&mdash;and Italy be exhausted. And none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
may be eaten becomingly without the oil and
vinegar dressing; all are the pleasanter for the
<i>soupçon</i> of onion, and the egg, hard-boiled; a
few gain by more variegated garniture.</p>

<p>But these minor salads&mdash;as they might be
classed&mdash;pale before the glories of the tomato:
the <i>pomodoro</i> of the Italian, the <i>pomme d'amour</i> of
the Provençal&mdash;sweet, musical names, that linger
tenderly on the lips. And, indeed, if the
tomato were veritably the "love apple" of the
Scriptures, and, in Adam's proprietorship, the
olives already yielded oil, the vines vinegar,
then the tragedy in the Garden of Eden may be
explained without the aid of commentary.
Many a man&mdash;Esau notably&mdash;has sold his birthright
for less than a good tomato salad.</p>

<p>Dante's <i>Inferno</i> were too good for the depraved
who prepare it, as if it were a paltry
pickle, with a dosing of vinegar. It must first
receive the stimulus of the onion; then its
dressing must be fortified by the least suspicion
of mustard&mdash;English, French, or German, it
matters not which&mdash;and if the pleasure that
follows does not reconcile you to Paradise lost,
as well might you live on dry bread and cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
water for the rest of your natural days. The
joys of the epicure, clearly, are not for you. It
seems base and sordid to offer for so exquisite
a delicacy hygienic references. But the world
is still full of misguided men who prize "dietetic
principles" above the delights of gluttony;
once assured that from the eating of the tomato
will come none of the evils "to which flesh is
<i>erroneously supposed</i> to be heir," they might be
induced to put tomato salad, made in right
fashion, to the test. Then must they be confirmed
faddists indeed, if they do not learn that
one eats not merely to digest.</p>

<p>To the mystical German, the potato first revealed
virtues undreamed of by the blind who
had thought it but a cheap article of food to
satisfy hunger, even by the French who had
carried it to such sublime heights in their <i>purées</i>
and <i>soufflés</i>, their <i>Parisiennes</i> and <i>Lyonnaises</i>.
Not until it has been allowed to cool, been cut
in thin slices, been dressed as a salad, were its
subtlest charms suspected. To the German&mdash;to
that outer barbarian of the midday dinner&mdash;we
owe at least this one great debt of gratitude.
Like none other, does the potato-salad lend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
itself to the most fantastic play of fancy. It
stimulates imagination, it awakens ambition.
A thousand and one ways there be of preparing
it, each better than the last. With celery, with
carrots, with tomatoes, with radishes, with
parsley, with cucumber, with every green thing
that grows&mdash;in greatest perfection with okras,
the vegetable dear to Hungarian and American,
unknown to poor Britons&mdash;it combines
graciously and deliciously, each combination a
new ecstasy. And, moreover, it is capable of
endless decoration; any woman with a grain of
ingenuity can make of it a thing of beauty, to
look upon which is to sharpen the dullest appetite.
So decorative are its possibilities, that at
times it is a struggle to decide between its
merits as an ornament and its qualities as a
delicacy. For truth is, it becomes all the more
palatable if dressed and "fatigued" an hour or
so before it is eaten, and the oil and vinegar
given time to soak through every slice and
fragment. The wise will disdain, for the purpose,
the ordinary potato, but procure instead
the little, hard "salad potato," which never
crumbles; it comes usually from Hamburg,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
and is to be bought for a trifle in the German
<i>delicatessen</i> shops of London.</p>

<p>Poetic in the early spring is the salad of
"superb asparagus"&mdash;pity it should ever be
eaten hot with drawn butter!&mdash;or of artichoke,
or of cucumber&mdash;the latter never fail to sprinkle
with parsley, touch with onion, and "fatigue"
a good half hour before serving. Later, the
French bean, or the scarlet runner should be
the lyrical element of the feast. And in winter,
when curtains are drawn and lamps lit,
and fires burn bright, the substantial <i>Soissons</i>,
for all its memories of French commercials, is
not to be despised. But, if your soul aspires to
more ethereal flights, then create a vegetable
salad&mdash;cauliflower, and peas, and potatoes, and
beans, and carrots in rhythmical proportions
and harmonious blending of hues.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE SALADS OF SPAIN</h2>

<p>They are still many and delicious as when
Beckford ate them and was glad, a hundred
and more years ago. The treasures of the
Incas have dwindled and disappeared; the Alhambra
has decayed and been restored on its
high hill-top; the masterpieces of Velasquez
have been torn from palace walls, to hang in
convenient rows in public museums; the greatness
of Spain has long been waning. But the
Spaniard still mixes his salads with the art and
distinction that have been his for centuries.
Herein, at least, his genius has not been
dimmed, nor his success grown less. And so
long as this remains true, so long will there be
hope of a new Renaissance in the Iberian peninsula.
By a nation's salads may you judge of
its degree of civilisation; thus tested, Spain is
in the van, not the rear, of all European countries.</p>

<p>It is no small achievement to give distinctive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
character to national salads, to-day that the
virtue of vinegar and oil and the infallibility
of incomparable onion are universally acknowledged
and respected. And yet Spain, in no
idle spirit of self-puffery, can boast of this
achievement. She has brought to her <i>insalada</i>
a new element, not wholly unknown elsewhere&mdash;in
Hungary, for instance&mdash;but one which
only by the Spaniard has been fully appreciated,
constantly introduced, and turned to
purest profit. This element&mdash;need it be said?&mdash;is
the pepper, now red, now green. The
basis of the Spanish salad may be&mdash;nay, is&mdash;the
same as in other lands: tomato, cucumber,
lettuce, beans, potatoes. But to these is added
pepper&mdash;not miserably dried and powdered, but
fresh and whole, or in generous slices&mdash;and behold!
a new combination is created, a new flavour
evolved. And it is a flavour so strong,
yet subtle withal, so aromatic and spicy, so
<i>bizarre</i> and picturesque&mdash;dream-inspiring as the
aroma of green Chartreuse, stimulating as Cognac
of ripe years&mdash;that the wonder is its praises
hitherto have not been more loudly sung, its
delights more widely cultivated. The trumpet-note
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
struck by the glowing scarlet is fitting
herald of the rapturous thrills that follow in
the eating. Not more voluptuous than the
salad thus adorned were the beauties of the
harem, who doubtless feasted upon it under the
cypresses and myrtles of Andalusia.</p>

<p>The tendency of the Spaniard is ever to harmony,
intricate and infinite. Is not his dish of
dishes his <i>olla cocida</i>? Is not his favourite course
of vegetables the <i>pisto</i>? And so likewise with
his salads: now he may give you tomato just
touched with pepper, cucumber just enlivened
by the same stirring presence. But more often
he will present you an arrangement which, in
its elaboration, may well baffle the first investigation
of the student. Peppers, as like as not
of both species, tomatoes, cucumber, onion,
garlic cut fine as if for a mince of greens&mdash;"pepper
hash," the American crudely calls an
arrangement closely akin in motive&mdash;are mingled
together so deftly, are steeped in vinegar
and oil so effectually, as to seem, not many in
one, but <i>the</i> one in many, the crowning glory
of the glorious vegetable world of the South.
Nothing in common has this delectable salad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
with the <i>macédoine</i>, which the Spaniard also
makes. Peas and carrots, potatoes and tomatoes,
beans and cauliflowers meet to new purpose,
when peppers, red and ardent, wander
hither and thither in their midst waging war
upon insipidity, destroying, as if by fire, the
tame and the commonplace. Again, lettuce
untainted by garlic, resisting the slightest suspicion
of complexity, may answer for the foolish
foreigner who knows no better. But in
lettuce prepared for himself the Spaniard spares
not the fragrant garlic; neither does he omit
his beloved peppers, while he never rebels, rejoicing
rather, if occasional slices of cucumber
and tomatoes lie hid between the cool green
leaves.</p>

<p>But fish furnishes him with text for still more
eloquent flights, still loftier compositions. A
<i>mayonnaise</i> he can make such as never yet was
eaten under milder suns and duller skies; and
a <i>mayonnaise</i> far from exhausts his all but unlimited
resources. Sardines he will take, or
tunny, or any fish that swims, and that, already
cooked, has been either shut up long weeks in
protecting tins or left but a few hours to cool.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Whatever the fish chosen, he places it neatly
and confidently at the bottom of his dish; above
it he lays lettuce leaves and garlic and long
brilliant slices of scarlet pepper; round about
it he weaves a garniture of olives and hard-boiled
eggs that reveal their hearts of gold.
The unrivalled, if cosmopolitan, sauce of vinegar
and oil is poured upon the whole and made
doubly welcome. But details are varied in
every fish salad served in Spain; only in its
perfection does it prove unalterable.</p>

<p>These, and their hundred offshoots were conceived
in serious moments. But once, in sheer
levity of spirit and indolence, the gay Andalusian
determined to invent a salad that, to the
world beyond his snowy Sierras, would seem
wildest jest, but to himself would answer for
food and drink, and, because of its simplicity
and therefore cheapness, save him many a useless
hour of gaining his dinner at the sweat of
his brow. And so, to the strumming of guitars
and click of castanets, now never heard save in
books of travel through Andalusia, <i>gaspacho</i> appeared;
destined to be for ever after the target
for every travel-writer's wit, the daily fare of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
its inventor and his descendants. To the Andalusian
<i>gaspacho</i> is as <i>macaroni</i> to the Neapolitan,
<i>bouillabaisse</i> to the Provençal, chops and
steaks to the Englishman. In hotels, grotesquely
French or pretentiously English,
where butter comes out of tins, and salad is
garlicless, <i>gaspacho</i> may be but surreptitiously
concocted for the secret benefit of the household.
But go to the genuine Andalusian <i>posada</i>
or house, travel in Andalusian boat, or breakfast
at Andalusian buffet, and ten to one <i>gaspacho</i>
figures on the <i>menu</i>.</p>

<p>To describe it, Gautier must be borrowed
from. What would you? When the master
has pronounced upon any given subject, why
add an inefficient postscript? When a readymade
definition, admirably rendered, is at your
command, why be at the pains of making a new
one for yourself? Never be guilty of any work
when others may do it for you, is surely the one
and only golden rule of life. Listen, then, to
the considerate Gautier: "<i>Gaspacho</i> deserves a
description to itself, and so we shall give here
the recipe which would have made the late
Brillat-Savarin's hair stand on end. You pour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
water into a soup tureen, to this water you add
vinegar" (why omit the oil, you brilliant but
not always reliable poet?), "shreds of garlic,
onions cut in quarters, slices of cucumber, some
pieces of pepper, a pinch of salt; then you add
bits of bread, which are left to soak in this
agreeable mess, and you serve cold." It should
be further explained that, in the season, tomatoes
are almost invariably introduced, that they
and all the greens are chopped up very fine,
and that the whole has the consistency of a
<i>julienne</i> supplied with an unusually lavish quantity
of vegetables. It is eaten with a spoon
from a soup plate, though on the <i>menu</i> it appears
as a course just before the sweets. This explanation
made, listen again to Gautier, who
writes in frivolous mood. "With us, dogs but
tolerably well bred would refuse to compromise
their noses in such a mixture. It is the favourite
dish of the Andalusians, and the prettiest
women, without fear, swallow at evening great
spoonfuls of this infernal soup. <i>Gaspacho</i> is
held to be most refreshing, an opinion which
to us seems a trifle daring, and yet, extraordinary
as it may be found at the first taste, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
finish by accustoming yourself to it, and even
liking it."</p>

<p>He was right. <i>Gaspacho</i> has its good points:
it is pleasant to the taste, piquant in its very
absurdity; it is refreshing, better than richly-spiced
sauces when the sun shines hot at midday.
Andalusians have not been labouring
under a delusion these many years. The pepper
is a stimulant; vinegar, oil, and water
unite in a drink more cooling and thirst-quenching
than abominable red wine of Valdepeñas.
Would you be luxurious, would you
have your <i>gaspacho</i> differ somewhat from the
poor man's, drop in a lump of ice, and double
will be your pleasure in the eating.</p>

<p>Like all good things <i>gaspacho</i> has received
that sincerest form of flattery, imitation; and,
what is more gratifying, received it at home.
Lettuce, cut in tiny pieces, is set floating in a
large bowl of water, vinegar, and oil, well
seasoned with salt. Refreshing this also is
claimed to be; though so strange a sight is it
to the uninitiated that a prim schoolma'am,
strayed from Miss Wilkins's stories into Andalusia,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
and heard to declare that that salad would

thoughts. Happy Spain, to have so conquered!

<h2 class="p4">THE STIRRING SAVOURY</h2>

<p>First impressions have their value: they may
not be dismissed in flippancy of spirit. But
for this reason must last impressions be held
things of nought, not worthy the consideration
of ambitious or intelligent man? First
impressions at times are washed away by the
rich, fast stream of after-events, even as the
first on a slate disappear under the obliterating
sponge; last impressions remain to bear testimony
after the more tangible facts have passed
into the <i>ewigkeit</i>. Else, where the use of the
ballade's <i>envoy</i>, of the final sweet or stirring
scene as the curtain falls upon the play?</p>

<p>It is the same with all the arts&mdash;with love,
too, for that matter, were there but space to
prove it. Love, however, dwindles in importance
when there is question of dinner or breakfast.
Life consists of eating and drinking, as
greater philosophers than Sir Andrew Aguecheek
have learned to their infinite delight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
have preached to the solace of others. Therefore,
so order your life that the last impressions
of your eating and drinking may be more
joyful, more beautiful than the first; then, and
only then, will you have solved that problem of
problems which, since the world began, has set
many a Galahad upon long and weary quest.
It behoves you to see that the feast, which
opened with ecstasy, does not close with platitude,
and thus cover you with shame and confusion.
A paltry amateur, a clumsy bungler,
is he who squanders all his talent upon the
soup, and leaves the savoury to take care of
itself. Be warned in time!</p>

<p>The patriotic claim the savoury as England's
invention. Their patriotism is pretty and
pleasing; moreover, it is not without a glimmering
of truth. For to England belongs the
glorious discovery that the dinner which ends
with a savoury ends with rapture that passeth
human understanding! The thing itself has its
near of kin, its ancestors, as one might say.
Caviar, olives, lax, anchovies, herrings' roe,
sardines, and as many more of the large and
noble family&mdash;do not these appear as <i>antipasti</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
in Italy? In Russia and Scandinavia do they
not, spread symmetrically on side table, serve
the purpose of America's cocktail? And among
the palms, as among the pines, coldness is held
to be an essential quality in them. Hot from
the ardent oven, the Parisian welcomes their
presence between the soup and the fish, and
many are the enthusiasts who declare this to be
the one and only time for their discreet appearance
upon the <i>menu</i>. Reason is in the plea:
none but the narrow-minded would condemn it
untested and untried. He who prizes change,
who rebels even against the monotony of the
perfect, may now and again follow this fashion
so gaily applauded by <i>gourmets</i> of distinction.
But, remembering the <i>much</i> that depends upon
last impressions, the wise will reserve his savoury
to make therewith a fair, brave ending.</p>

<p>There still walk upon this brutal earth poor
heedless women who, in the innocence of their
hearts, believe that the one destiny of cheese is
to lie, cut up in little pieces, in a three-cornered
dish, which it shares with misplaced biscuits
and well-meaning rolls of butter, and, it may
be, chilling celery. But cheese, which in many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
ways has achieved such marvels, may be wrought
into savouries beyond compare. As <i>soufflé</i>, either
<i>au Gruyère</i> or <i>au Parmesan</i>, it becomes light and
dainty as the poet's lyric, and surely should be
served only on porcelain of the finest. It is
simple to say how the miracle is worked: a
well-heated oven, a proper saucepan, butter,
water, pepper, salt and sugar in becoming proportions,
the yolks of eggs and grated Parmesan,
the whites of the eggs added, as if an
afterthought; and twenty-five minutes in the
expectant oven will do the rest. But was ever
lyric turned out by rule and measure? Even
the inspired artist has been known to fail with
his <i>soufflé</i>. Here, indeed, is a miracle, best
entrusted to none but the genius.</p>

<p><i>Canapé au Parmesan</i> has pretensions which the
result justifies. On the bread, fried as golden
as the haloes of Fra Angelico's angels, the
grated Parmesan, mingled with salt and pepper,
is spread. A Dutch oven yields temporary
asylum until the cheese be melted, when,
quicker than thought, the <i>canapés</i> are set upon a
pretty dish and served to happy mortals. <i>Ramaquins</i>
of cheese, in cases or out, can boast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
charms the most seductive. Nor in <i>gougère</i> or
<i>beignet</i> or <i>bouchée</i> will Parmesan betray confidence.
Again, in <i>pailles</i>, or straws, on fire with
cayenne, and tied with fluttering ribbons into
enticing bunches, this happy child of the South
reveals new powers of seduction. So long as
there is cheese to command, the most fastidious
need not wander far in search of savouries.</p>

<p>The anchovy may be made a dangerous rival
to Parmesan. Whole, or in paste, it yields enchanting
harmonies, burning and fervent as
lover's prayer. Let your choice fall upon the
boneless anchovies of France, if you would aim
at the maximum of pleasure and the minimum
of labour. True it is that labour in the kitchen
is ever a joy; but, expended upon one creation
when it might be divided among many, must
not sacrifice of variety in sensation be the price
paid? Fried after the fashion of whitebait,
sprinkled with <i>paprika</i>, and refreshed with
lemon juice, anchovies become quite irresistible
as <i>Orlys d'anchois</i>. Prepared in cases, like
Parmesan, they are proof against criticism as
<i>tartelettes</i>. Now figuring as <i>petites bouchées</i>, now
as <i>rissolettes</i>, they fail not to awaken new and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
delicious emotions. They simply clamour for
certain exquisite combinations, to-day with
hard-boiled egg passed through a sieve, to-morrow
with olives from sunny Provence; thin
brown bread and butter, or toast, the crisp
foundation. But rarely do they go masquerading
so riotously as in the garb of <i>croûtes d'anchois</i>:
first, the golden <i>croûton</i>, then a slice of
tomato, then a slice of cucumber, then a layer
of caviar, then a layer of anchovies scarlet with
<i>paprika</i> and garnished with leaves of chervil;
and behold! you have a pyramid more memorable
far than any raised on Egyptian sands&mdash;a
pyramid that you need not travel silly miles
to see: it is yours, any day and any hour, for
the ordering.</p>

<p>Lax laid lightly on toast is a pale rose triumph.
<i>Olives farcies</i>&mdash;caper and anchovy chief
ingredients of the <i>farce</i>&mdash;come like a flaming
ray of southern sunlight. Haddock is smoked
in the land across the border solely that it may
ravish the elect in its grandest phase as <i>croustades
de merluche fumée</i>. By the shores of the blue
Mediterranean, sardines are packed in tins that
the delicate diner of the far north may know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
pleasure's crown of pleasure in <i>canapé de sardines
diablées</i>. Caviar craves no more elaborate seasoning
than lemon juice and <i>paprika</i> can give;
herring roe sighs for devilled biscuit as friendly
resting-place. Shrimp and lobster vie with
one another for the honour either <i>bouchée</i> or
<i>canapé</i> bestows. And ham and tongue pray
eagerly to be grated and transformed into bewildering
<i>croûtes</i>. The ever-willing mushroom
refuses to be outsped in the blessed contest, but
murmurs audibly, "<i>Au gratin</i> I am adorable;"
while the egg whispers, "Stuff me, and the
roses and raptures are yours!"</p>

<p>But what would the art of eating be without
the egg? In two strange and striking combinations
it carries the savoury to the topmost
rung in the ladder of gastronomy. Its union
with inexhaustible anchovy and Bombay duck
has for issue "Bombay toast," the very name
whereof has brought new hope to staid dons
and earnest scholars. Pledged to anchovies
once more and butter and cream&mdash;Mormon-like
in its choice of many mates&mdash;it offers as result
"Scotch woodcock," a challenge to fill high the
glass with Claret red and rare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Endless is the stimulating list. For cannot
the humble bloater be pressed into service, and
the modest cod? Do not many more vegetables
than spinach, that plays so strong a part in
<i>Raviole à la Genoese</i>, answer promptly when
called upon for aid? And what of the gherkin?
What of the almond&mdash;the almond mingled
with caviar and cayenne? And what of
this, that, and the other, and ingenious combinations
by the score? Be enterprising! Be
original! And success awaits you.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">INDISPENSABLE CHEESE</h2>

<p>With bread and cheese and kisses for daily
fare, life is held to be perfect by the poet. But
love may grow bitter before cheese loses its
savour. Therefore the wise, who value the
pleasures of the table above tender dalliance,
put their faith in strong Limburger or fragrant
Brie, rather than in empty kisses. If only this
lesson of wisdom could be mastered by all men
and women, how much less cruel life might be!</p>

<p>Nor is cheese without its poetry to comfort
the hater of pure prose. Once the "glory of
fair Sicily," there must ever linger about it
sweet echoes of Sicilian song sung under the
wild olives and beneath the elms, where Theocritus
"watched the visionary flocks." Did not
"a great white cream-cheese" buy that wondrous
bowl&mdash;the "miracle of varied work"&mdash;for
which Thyrsis sang the pastoral song? Cheese-fed
were the shepherds who piped in the shadow
of the ilex tree, while the calves were dancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
in the soft green grass; cheese-scented was the
breath of the fair maidens and beautiful youths
they loved. Is there a woman with soul so
dead, who, when in a little country inn fresh
cheese is laid before her, cannot fancy that she
sees the goats and kids among the tamarisks of
the sun-kissed Sicilian hills, and hears the perfect
voices of Daphnis and Menalcas, the two
herdsmen "skilled in song"?</p>

<p>Perhaps because cheese has been relegated
to the last course at midday breakfast, or at
dinner, has it lost much of its charm for the
heedless. But who, indeed, playing with peach
or orange at dessert, knows the fruit's true flavour
as well as he who plucks it fresh from the
tree while wandering through the peach orchards
of Delaware or the orange groves of
Florida? Take a long walk over the moors
and through the heather, or cycle for hours
along winding lanes, and then, at noon, eat a
lunch of bread and cheese, and&mdash;even without
the kisses&mdash;you will find in the frugal fare a
godlike banquet. Time was when bits cut
from the huge carcase of a well-battered Cheddar,
washed down with foaming shandygaff,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
seemed more delicious far than the choicest
dishes at the Lapérouse or Voisin's. Memory
journeys back with joy to the fragrant, tough,
little goat's cheese, with flask of Chianti, set
out upon the rough wooden table in front of
some wayside vine-trellised <i>albergo</i>, while traveller
and cycle rested at the hour when shade is
most pleasant to men. How many a tramp,
through the valleys and over the passes of Switzerland,
has been made the easier by the substantial
slice of good Gruyère and the cup of
wine well cooled in near snow-drifts! How
many rides awheel through the pleasant land
of France have been the swifter for the Camembert
and roll devoured by the way!</p>

<p>Places and hours there are when cheese is
best. But seldom is it wholly unwelcome.
From dinner, whatever may then be its limitations,
some think it must never be omitted.
Remember, they say, as well a woman with but
one eye as a last course without cheese. But
see that you show sympathy and discretion in
selecting the variety most in harmony with
your <i>menu</i>, or else the epicure's labours will indeed
be lost. It is not enough to visit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
cheesemonger's, and to accept any and every
kind offered. The matter is one requiring time
and thought and long experience. You must
understand the possibilities of each cheese
chosen, you must bear in mind the special requirements
of each meal prepared. Preposterous
it would be truly to serve the mild-flavoured
plebeian species from Canada or America after
a carefully ordered dinner at Verrey's; wasteful,
to use adorable Port Salut or aromatic
Rocquefort for a pudding or a Welsh rabbit.</p>

<p>Study gastronomic proprieties, cultivate your
imagination, and as the days follow each other
fewer will be your mistakes. Heavy Stilton
and nutritious Cheddar, you will know, belong
by right to undisguised joint and irrepressible
greens: to a "good old-fashioned English dinner"
they prove becoming accompaniments.
Excellent they are, after their fashion, to be
honoured and respected; but something of the
seriousness and the stolidity of their native
land has entered into them, and to gayer, more
frivolous moods they are as unsuited as a sermon
to a ballroom. If, however, to the joint
you cling with tenacity, and solemn Stilton be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the cheese of your election, do not fail to ripen
it with port of the finest vintage or good old
ale gently poured into holes, here and there
scooped out for the purpose, and then filled
once more with the cheese itself.</p>

<p>Strength, fierce in perfume and flavour alike,
lies in Limburger, but it is strength which demands
not beef or mutton, but <i>wurst</i> and <i>sauerkraut</i>.
Take it not home with you, unless you
would place a highly-scented barrier between
yourself and your friends; but, in deep thankfulness
of heart, eat it after you have lunched
well and heartily in the Vienna Cafe, which
overlooks Leicester Square, or in that other
which commands Mudie's and Oxford Street.
And thanks will be deepened a hundredfold if,
while eating, you call for a long refreshing
draught of Munich beer.</p>

<p>Sweet, redolent of herbs, are gracious Gorgonzola,
of which such ribald tales are told by
the irreverent, and royal Rocquefort, in its silver
wrapping; eaten after "the perfect dinner,"
each has merit immeasurable&mdash;merit
heightened by a glass of Beaune or Chambertin.
Then, too, is the hour for Port Salut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
with its soothing suggestion of monastic peace
and contentment, alone a safeguard against
indigestion and other unspeakable horrors; if
you respect your appetite seek it nowhere save
in the German <i>delicatessen</i> shop, but there order
it with an easy conscience and confidence in
the white-coated, white-aproned ministering
spirit at the counter. Thither also turn for
good Camembert; but, as you hope for pleasure
in the eating, be not too ready to accept the
first box offered: test the cheese within with
sensitive finger, and value it according to its
softness, for an unripe Camembert, that crumbles
at touch of the knife, is deadlier far than
all the seven deadly sins. It should be soft
and flowing almost as languid <i>Fromage de Brie</i>,
indolent and melting on its couch of straw.
Beyond all cheese, Gruyère calls for study and
reflection, so many are the shams, by an unscrupulous
market furnished, in its place. As
palely yellow as a Liberty scarf, as riddled
with holes as cellular cotton, it should be sweet
as Port Salut, and yet with a reserve of strength
that makes it the rival of Limburger.</p>

<p>But blessed among cheeses, a romance in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
itself, is the creamy, subtle little <i>Suisse</i>, delectable
as Dumas calls it. Soft and sweet as the
breath of spring, it belongs to the season of
lilacs and love. Its name evokes a vision of
Paris, radiant in the Maytime, the long avenues
and boulevards all white and pink with blossoming
horse-chestnuts, the air heavy laden
with the fragrance of flowers; a vision of the
accustomed corner in the old restaurant looking
out upon the Seine, and of the paternal waiter
bearing the fresh <i>Suisse</i> on dainty green leaf.
Life holds few such thrilling interludes! You
may eat it with salt, and think yourself old and
wise; but why not be true to the spirit of
spring? Why not let yourself go a little, and,
eating your <i>Suisse</i> with sugar, be young and
foolish and unreasonably happy again?</p>

<p>Authorities there be who rank the <i>Broccio</i> of
Corsica above the <i>Suisse</i>, and credit it with delicious
freshness and Virgilian flavour. To
taste it among its wild hills, then, would be
well worth the long journey to the island in the
Mediterranean. In the meantime, however,
none need quarrel with <i>Suisse</i>. Hardly a country
or district in the world really that has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
its own special cheese; he who would discover
them all and catalogue them must needs write
a treatise on geography.</p>

<p>But to eat cheese in its many varieties, with
butter or salt or sugar, as the case may be, and
to think its mission thus fulfilled, would be to
underestimate its inexhaustible resources. Innumerable
are the masterpieces the culinary
artist will make of it. In an omelet you would
pronounce it unsurpassable, so long as kind
fate did not set before you the consummate
<i>Fondue</i>. As a pudding you would declare it
not to be approached, if sometimes crisp cheese
straws were not served with dinner's last course.
On an ocean voyage, Welsh-rabbit late at night
will seem to you the marvel of marvels; on a
railway journey a cheese sandwich at noon you
will think still more miraculous&mdash;but let the
sandwich be made of brown bread, and mix
butter and mustard and anchovies with the
cheese. The wonders that may be worked with
Parmesan alone&mdash;whether in conjunction with
<i>macaroni</i>, or soup, or cauliflower, or many a
dish beside&mdash;would be eloquent text for a new
chapter.</p>

<hr class="c35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">A STUDY IN GREEN AND RED</h2>

<p>You may search from end to end of the vast
Louvre; you may wander from room to room
in England's National Gallery; you may travel
to the Pitti, to the Ryks Museum, to the Prado;
and no richer, more stirring arrangement of
colour will you find than in that corner of your
kitchen garden where June's strawberries grow
ripe. From under the green of broad leaves
the red fruit looks out and up to the sun in
splendour unsurpassed by paint upon canvas.
And the country, with lavish prodigality born
of great plenty, takes pity upon the drear, drab
town, and, packing this glory of colour in baskets
and crates, despatches it to adorn greengrocer's
window and costermonger's cart.
"Strawberries all ripe, sixpence a pound," is
the itinerant sign which now sends a thrill
through Fleet Street and brings joy to the
Strand.</p>

<p>To modern weakling the strawberry is strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
with the strength of classical approval. The
Greek loved it; the Latin vied with him in the
ardour of his affection. Poets sang its wonders
and immortalised its charms. Its perfume was
sweet in the nostrils of Virgil; its flavour enraptured
the palate of Ovid; and at banquets
under the shadow of the Acropolis and on sunny
Pincian Hill, the strawberry, cultivated and
wild, held place of honour among the dear
fruits of the earth.</p>

<p>Nor did it disappear before the barbarian's
inroads. Europe might be laid waste; beauty
and learning and art might be aliens in the
land that was once their home; human enjoyment
might centre upon a millennium to come
rather than upon delights already warm within
men's grasp. But still the strawberry survived.
Life grew ugly and rue and barren.
But from under broad leaves the little red fruit
still looked out and up to the sun; and, by
loveliness of colour and form, of flavour and
scent, proved one of the chief factors in reclaiming
man from barbarism, in leading him
gently along the high road to civilisation and
the joy of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Respect for its exquisite perfection was ever
deep and heartfelt. Gooseberries might be
turned to wine and figure as fools; raspberries
and currants might be imprisoned within stodgy
puddings. But the strawberry, giver of health,
creator of pleasure, seldom was submitted to
desecration by fire. As it ripened, thus was it
eaten: cool, scarlet, and adorable. At times
when, according to the shifting of the seasons,
its presence no longer made glad the hearts of
its lovers, desire invented a substitute. As the
deserted swain takes what cold comfort he can
from the portrait of his mistress, so the faithful
stayed themselves with the strawberry's counterfeit.
And thus was it made: "Take the
paste of Massepain, and roul it in your hands
in form of a Strawberry, then wet it in the
juice of Barberries or red Gooseberries, turn
them about in this juice pretty hard, then take
them out and put them into a dish and dry
them before a fire, then wet them again for
three or four times together in the same juice,
and they will seem like perfect Strawberries."
Master Cook Giles Rose is the authority, and
none knew better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
If, in moment of folly, in an effort to escape
monotony, however sweet, the strawberry was
robbed of its freshness, it was that it might be
enclosed in a tart. Then&mdash;how account for
man's inconsistency?&mdash;it was so disguised, so
modified by this, that, or the other companion
in misery, that it seemed less a strawberry
than ever Master Rose's ingenious counterfeit.
And, in witness thereof, read Robert May, the
Accomplished Cook, his recipe: "Wash the
strawberries and put them into the tart; season
them with cinnamon, ginger, and a little red
wine, then put on the sugar, bake it half an
hour, ice it, scrape on sugar, and serve it." A
pretty mess, in truth, and yet, for sentiment's
sake, worth repetition in this degenerate latter
day. Queen Anne preserved the tradition of her
Stuart forefathers, and in "The Queen's Royal
Cooker," a little book graced by the Royal portrait,
Robert May's tart reappears, cinnamon,
ginger, and all. So it was handed down from
generation to generation, cropping up here and
there with mild persistency, and now at last,
after long career of unpopularity, receiving
distinction anew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
One tart in a season, as tribute to the past,
will suffice. It were a shame to defile the delicate
fruit in more unstinted quantities. Reserve
it rather for dessert, that in fragile
porcelain dish or frail glass bowl it may lose
nothing of the fragrance and crispness and
glow of colour that distinguished it as it lay
upon the brown earth under cool green shelter.
To let it retain unto the very last its little green
stem is to lend to dinner or breakfast table the
same stirring, splendid harmony that lit up, as
with a flame, the kitchen garden's memorable
corner. But if with cream the fruit is to be
eaten, then comfort and elegance insist upon
green stem's removal before ever the bowl be
filled or the dish receive its dainty burden.</p>

<p>At early "little breakfast" of coffee and rolls,
or tea and toast, as you will, what more delicious,
what fresher beginning to the day's heat
and struggles, then the plate of strawberries
newly picked from their bed? Banish cream
and sugar from this initiative meal. At the
dawn of daily duty and pleasure, food should
be light and airy and unsubstantial. Then the
stem, clinging fast to the fruit's luscious flesh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
is surely in place. Half the delight is in plucking
the berry from the plate as if from the bush.</p>

<p>After midday breakfast, after evening dinner,
however, it is another matter. Cream
now is in order; cream, thick and sweet and
pure, covering the departing strawberry with a
white pall, as loving and tender as the snow
that protects desolate pastures and defenceless
slopes from winter's icy, inexorable fingers.
Sprinkle sugar with the cream, as flowers
might be strewn before the altars of Dionysius
and Demeter.</p>

<p>Cream may, for time being, seem wholly
without rivals as the strawberry's mate, the
two joined together by a bond that no man
would dare put asunder. But the strawberry
has been proven fickle in its loves&mdash;a very Cressida
among fruits. For to Kirsch it offers ecstatic
welcome, while Champagne meets with
no less riotous greeting. To Cognac it will
dispense its favours with easy graciousness,
and from the hot embrace of Maraschino it
makes no endeavour to escape. Now, it may
seem as simple and guileless as Chloe, and
again as wily and well-versed as Egypt's far-famed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Queen. But with the results of its several
unions who will dare find fault? In each
it reveals new, unsuspecting qualities, subtle
and ravishing. On pretty, white-draped tea-table,
rose-embowered, carnation-scented, the
strawberry figures to fairest advantage when
Champagne holds it in thrall; in this hour and
bower cream would savour of undue heaviness,
would reveal itself all too substantial and palpable
a lover. Again, when elaborate dinner
draws to an end, and dessert follows upon long
procession of soup and fish and <i>entrées</i> and roasts
and vegetables and salads and poultry and
sweets and savouries, and who knows what&mdash;then
the strawberry becomes most irresistible
upon yielding itself, a willing victim, to the
bold demands of Kirsch. A <i>macédoine</i> of Kirsch-drowned
strawberries, iced to a point, is a dish
for which gods might languish without shame.</p>

<p>She who loves justice never fears to tell the
whole truth and nothing but the truth. To
cook the strawberry is to rob it of its sweetest
bloom and freshness. But there have been
others to think otherwise, as it must in fairness
be added. To the American, strawberry short-cake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
represents one of the summits of earthly
bliss. In ices, many will see the little fruit
buried without a pang of regret; and the device
has its merits. As syrup, distended with
soda-water and ice-cream, the conservative Londoner
may now drink it at Fuller's. In the
flat, open, national tart, the Frenchman places
it, and congratulates himself upon the work of
art which is the outcome. Or, accepting Gouffé
as master, he will soar, one day, to the extraordinary
heights of <i>coupe en nougat garnie de
fraises</i>, and find a flamboyant colour-print to
serve as guide; the next he will descend to the
mere homeliness of <i>beignets de fraises</i>; and, as
he waxes more adventurous, he will produce
<i>bouchées de dame</i>, or <i>pain à la duchesse</i>, <i>madeleines en
surprise</i> or <i>profiteroles</i>, each and all with the
strawberry for motive. The spirit of enterprise
is to be commended, and not one of
Gouffé's list but will repay the student in
wealth of experience gained. The lover, however,
finds it not always easy to remember the
student within him, and if joy in the eating be
his chief ambition, he will be constant to the
fresh fruit ever.</p>

<h2 class="p4 center">A MESSAGE FROM THE<br />
SOUTH</h2>

<p>What know we of the orange in our barbarous
North? To us it is an alien, a makeshift,
that answers well when, our own harvests over,
winter, sterile and gloomy, settles upon the
land. But in the joyous South all the year
round it ripens, its golden liquid a solace when
heat and dust parch the throat, as when winds
from the frozen North blow with unwonted
cold. The tree that bears it is as eager to produce
as the mothers of Israel, and, in its haste
and impatience, often it whitens its branches
with blossoms while still they glow with fruit,
even as Beckford long since saw them in the
groves of Naples.</p>

<p>Bright, rich colour the costermonger's barrow,
piled high with oranges from distant
Southern shores, gives to London's dingy
streets; and not a greengrocer's window but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
takes on new beauty and resplendence when
decorated by the brilliant heaps. But meretricious
seems the loveliness of the orange here,
when once it has been seen hanging from
heavy-laden boughs, gleaming between cool
dark leaves in its own home, whether on Guadalquivir's
banks or Naples' bay, whether in
western Florida or eastern Jaffa. What has a
fruit that languishes in the garden of Lindajara
and basks in Amalfi's sunshine, to do with London
costermongers and fog-drenched shops?</p>

<p>Wearied and jaded by the long journey, disheartened
by the injustice done to it when
plucked in its young, green immaturity, it
grows sour and bitter by the way, until, when
it comes to the country of its exile, but a faint,
feeble suggestion of its original flavour remains.
With us, for instance, does not the
orange of Valencia mean a little, thin-skinned,
acid, miserable fruit, only endurable when
smothered in sugar or drowned in Cognac?
But eaten in Valencia, what is it then and
there? Large and ample are its seductive
proportions; its skin, deeply, gloriously golden,
forswears all meagreness, though never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
too thick to shut out the mellowing sunshine;
its juice flows in splendid streams as if to vie
with the Sierra's quenchless springs; and the
fruit is soft and sweet as the sweet, soft Southern
maidens whose white teeth meet and gleam
in its pulp of pure, uncontaminated gold. A
fruit this for romance&mdash;a fruit for the Houris
of Paradise; not to be peddled about in brutal
barrows among feather-bearing 'Arriets.</p>

<p>In the South, it were a crime not to eat this
fruit, created for the immortals, just as God
made it. Sugar could be added but to its dishonour;
the pots and pans of the sacrilegious
cook would be desecration unspeakable. Feast
then, upon its natural charms, and as the hot
Southern breeze brings to you the scent of
strange Southern blossoms, and the sky stretches
blindingly blue above, and <i>One</i> sits at your side
feasting in silent sympathy, fancy yourself, if
you will, the new Adam&mdash;or Eve&mdash;for whom
the flaming swords have been lowered, and the
long-closed gates of the Garden of Eden thrown
wide open.</p>

<p>But in the North, banish romance, banish
imagination; bring to the study of the orange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
the prose of necessity, and realism of the earnest
student. And sometimes, from prose&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;poetry may spring; from realism
will be evolved wild dreaming.</p>

<p>If the orange be from Jaffa, or "hail" from
Florida, and care bestowed upon it during its
long voyaging, then will it need no Northern
artifice to enhance the pleasure in its power to
give. True that something&mdash;much, indeed&mdash;it
will have lost; but something of its Southern,
spicy, subtle sweetness still survives&mdash;of the
Orient's glamour, of the mystery of the Western
wilderness of flower and fruit. Eat it,
therefore, as it is, unadorned, unspoiled. Tear
away tenderly the covering that cleaves to it so
closely; tear the fruit apart with intelligent
fingers; to cut it is to sacrifice its cooling juice
to inanimate china, and to deprive yourself of
the first freshness of its charms.</p>

<p>When, however, as generally&mdash;to our sorrow,
be it said&mdash;the orange arrives a parody of itself,
it were better to join it to one of its several
dearest affinities. In well-selected company, it
may recover the shadow, and more, of the
splendour it elsewhere enjoys in solitary state.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Thus disguised, it may wander from dessert to
the course of sweets, and by so wandering save
the resourceless from the monotony of rice and
rizine, batter and bread-and-butter puddings,
whose fitting realm is the nursery, and from an
eternity of tarts which do not, like a good design,
gain by repetition. In cocoanut, the
orange recognises a fellow exile, and the two,
coming together, yield a new flavour, a new
delight. For this purpose, the orange must be
cut that the juice may flow, and if in symmetrical
rounds, the effect will be more satisfying
to the critical. Let the slices be laid at once
in the bowl destined to hold them at the moment
of serving, that not a drop of juice may
escape, and arrange them so that over every
layer of orange reposes a layer of sugar. Then
taking the cocoanut that has been well drained,
grate it as fine as patience will allow; under it
bury the orange until the gold is all concealed,
and the dish looks white and light and soft as
the driven snow. No harm will be done, but,
on the contrary, much good, by preparing some
hours before dinner. It is a pretty conceit;
half unwillingly the spoon disturbs this summery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
snow-field. But well that it does, for the
combination pleases the palate no less than the
eye. The orange summons forth the most excellent
qualities of the cocoanut; the cocoanut
suppresses the acidity and crudeness of the
expatriated orange.</p>

<p>With sugar alone, the orange&mdash;of this secondary
order be it remembered&mdash;comes not
amiss, when the soul yearns for placidness and
peace. If more stirring sensations be craved,
baste the cut-up oranges and sugar with Cognac,
and eat to your own edification. Again
prepare some hours before serving, and be not
stingy with the Cognac: keep basting constantly;
and be certain that if the result please
you not, the fault lies not with the fruit and
spirits, both exultant in the unexpected union.</p>

<p>The conservative, unused to such devices,
envelop oranges in soulless fritters and imprison
them in stodgy puddings. Beware their
example! One followed, there is no telling the
depths of plodding imbecility to which you may
be plunged. Not for the frying-pan or the
pudding-bowl was the golden fruit predestined.
Better eat no sweets whatever than thus degrade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the orange and reveal our own shortcomings.</p>

<p>Who will deny that in the world's great
drinks the orange has played its part with
much distinction? In bitters it is supreme, if
gin in due proportions be added. And where
would mankind be by now, had the orange-evolved
liqueurs remained undiscovered? How
many happy after-dinner hours would never
have been! How insipid the flavour of Claret
and Champagne-cup! Even temperance drinks
may be endured when orange is their basis.
Go to Madrid or Granada, drink <i>bebida helada de
naranja</i>, and confess that in Spain the teetotallers,
if any such exist, have their compensation.
A <i>purée neigeuse, une espèce de glace liquide</i>,
Gautier described it in a moment of expansion;
and, when art is in question, what Gautier has
praised who would revile? With the Spanish
<i>bebida de naranja</i>, the American orange water
ice may dispute the palm.</p>

<p>In humbler incarnation it appears as marmalade,
without which the well-regulated household
can do as little as without sapolio or
Reckitt's blue. Who throughout the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Isles does not know the name of Keiller?
Bread and butter might better go than this
most British of British institutions, the country's
stay and support in time of peace, its bulwark
when war drives Tommy Atkins into
action. Thus has the North turned the South
to its own everyday uses, and the fruit of poets
passes into the food of millions.</p>

<p>In fruit salad, orange should be given a leading
and conspicuous rôle, the aromatic little
Tangerine competing gaily and guilelessly with
the ordinary orange of commerce. There is
scarce another fruit that grows with which it
does not assimilate, with which it does not
mingle, to the infinite advantage of the ardent
<i>gourmet</i>. This, none knows better than the
Spaniard, slandered sorely when reported a
barbarian at table. If some of his refinements
we could but imitate, artists truly we might be
considered. He it is who first thought to pour
upon his strawberries, not thick cream, but the
delicate juice of the orange freshly cut. Here
is a combination beyond compare; and is there
not many another that might be tested as
profitably? Orange and apricot, orange and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
plum, orange and peach. Experiment; for
even where failure follows, will not a new sensation
have been secured? The failure need
never be repeated. But to each new success
will be awarded life eternal.</p>

<h2 class="p4">ENCHANTING COFFEE</h2>

<p>A perfectly wise man is he who is fully expert
and skilful in the true use of sensualities, as in
all other duties belonging to life. In the
household where wisdom rules, dinner, from
savoury <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i> to aromatic coffee, will be
without reproach&mdash;or suspicion. The foolish
devote their powers to this course or that, and
in one supreme but ill-advised endeavour exhaust
their every resource. Invention carries
them no further than the soul; even discreet
imitation cannot pilot them beyond the <i>entrée</i>.
With each succeeding dish their folly becomes
more obvious, until it culminates in the coffee,
which, instead of the divine elixir it should be,
proves but a vile, degrading concoction of chicory.
Here is the chief among gastronomic
tests; the hostess who knows not how to prepare
a cup of coffee that will bring new light to
her guests' eyes, new gaiety to their talk, is
not worthy to receive them; the guest, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
does not know good coffee when it is set before
him deserves to be cast into outer darkness and
fed for evermore upon brimstone and treacle.
Better far throw pearls before swine, than pour
good coffee into the cups of the indifferent.</p>

<p>The sympathies of the gourmand are all for
the mighty ones of old&mdash;for an Epicurus in
Greece, a Lucullus in Rome&mdash;to whom the gods
had not yet given the greatest of their gifts,
coffee. Sad indeed the banquet, dreamy the
evening uncheered, unblessed by fragrant
Mocha or mild Mysore. Poor mortals still
stood without the gates of Paradise, never once
foreseeing the exquisite joys to come, unconscious
of the penalty they paid for living so
much too soon. And while they thus dwelt in
sorrowful ignorance, shepherds, leading their
flocks through sweet pasture-land, paused in
their happy singing to note that the little kids
and lambs, and even staid goats and sheep,
waxed friskier and merrier, and frolicked with
all the more light-hearted abandonment after
they had browsed upon a certain berry-bearing
bush. Thyme and lavender, mint and marjoram,
never thus got into their little legs, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
sent them flying off on such jolly rambles and
led them into such unseemly antics. And the
shepherds, no doubt, plucked the berry and
tasted it, and found it good. And one day&mdash;who
knows how?&mdash;by chance, they roasted it,
and the fragrance was as incense in their nostrils.
And then, another time they pounded
it, and, it may be by merest accident, it fell
into the water boiling over the fire for their
midday meal. And thus, first, coffee was made.</p>

<p>To Abyssinia, otherwise an unknown factor
in the history of good living, belongs the credit
of producing the first coffee-drinkers. All honour
where honour is due. The debt of the
modern to Greece and Rome is smaller far than
to that remote country which not one man in
ten, to whom coffee is a daily necessity, could
point out upon the map.</p>

<p>Arabs, wandering hither and thither, came
to Abyssinia as they journeyed, and there drank
the good drink and rejoiced. Among them
were pious Moslems, who at times nodded over
prayers, and, yawning pitifully as texts were
murmured by lazy lips, knew that damnation
must be their doom unless sleep were banished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
from their heavy eyes at prayer time. And to
them as to the sheep and lambs, as to the goats
and kids, the wonder-working berry brought
wakefulness and gaiety. And into Arabia the
Happy, they carried it in triumph, and coffee
was drunk not for temporal pleasure but for
spiritual uses. It kept worshippers awake and
alert for the greater glory of Allah, and the
faithful accepted it with praise and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>But, again, like the flocks in Abyssinian pastures,
it made them too alert, it seems. After
coffee, prayer grew frolicsome, and a faction
arose to call it an intoxicant, to declare the
drinking of it a sin against the Koran. Schisms
followed, and heresies, and evils dire and manifold.
But coffee fought a good fight against
its enemies and its detractors; and from Arabia
it passed to Constantinople, from Turkey to
England, and so on from country to country,
until in the end there was not one in Europe,
or in the New World (which men had not then
so long discovered), but had welcomed the
berry that clears the clouded brain and stimulates
the jaded body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
To all men its finest secrets have not been
revealed. Dishonoured by many it has been
and still is. Unspeakable liquids, some thick
and muddy, others thin and pale, borrow
its name with an assurance and insolence that
fool the ignorant. Chicory arrogantly and unscrupulously
pretends to compete with it, and
the thoughtless are deceived, and go their way
through life obdurate and unrepentant, deliberately
blinding themselves to the truth. Others
understand not the hour and the place, and
order it at strange moments and for stranger
functions. Americans there be who, from
thick, heavy, odious cups, drink it, plentifully
weakened with milk, as the one proper and fit
accompaniment for dinner; a spoonful of coffee
follows a spoonful of soup; another is prelude
to the joint; a second cup poisons the sweet.
On the other hand, be it admitted in fairness,
no coffee is purer and better than that of the
American who has not fallen into such mistaken
courses. And he who doubts should,
without delay, drop in at Fuller's in Regent
Street, or the Strand, where to taste is to
believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
In the afternoon, plump German matrons and
maids gather about the coffee-pot, and fancy,
poor souls! that they, of all womankind, are
most discriminating in their choice of time and
opportunity. Gossip flows smoothly on; household
matters are placidly discussed; and the
one and only end of coffee remains for them,
now and always, unknown and unsuspected.
In their blameless innocence and guileless confidence,
may they have whatever happiness
belongs by right to the race of humble and unaspiring
housewives.</p>

<p>In England the spurious is preferred to the
genuine; and rare, indeed, is the house or restaurant,
the hotel or lodgings, where good
coffee is the portion of blundering humanity.
Over the barbarous depths into which the soul-inspiriting
berry has been dragged in unhappy
Albion, it is kinder to draw a veil.</p>

<p>But in the inscrutable East, the cradle of
mysticism, where no problem discourages earnest
seekers after truth, coffee may yet be had
in full perfection. In the West, France is not
without her children of light, and in the tall
glass of the <i>café</i> or the deep bowl of the <i>auberge</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
coffee sometimes is not unworthy of the name,
though chicory, the base, now threatens its
ruin. However, Austria, nearer to the mother-country,
makes the coffee of France seem but a
paltry imitation, so delicious is the beautiful
brown liquid, flowing in rich perennial streams
in every <i>café</i>, gilded or more modest. And yet
Austria, in her turn, is eclipsed, wholly and
completely, by the home of Attila and Kossuth.
Drink, if only once, coffee on the banks of the
Danube, while gipsies "play divinely into your
ear," and life will never more seem quite so
meaningless.</p>

<p>It is not easy to understand why the multitude
continue content with a bad substitute
when the thing itself, in all its strength and
sweetness, may be had for the asking. A little
knowledge, a trifle more experience, and good
coffee may be the solace and stimulus of the
honest Briton, as of the wily Turk, the wandering
Arab, and the fierce Magyar.</p>

<p>Know then, first, that your coffee berries
must be pure and unadulterated. Turn a deaf
ear to the tempter who urges economy and
promises additional flavour. Against chicory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
protest cannot be too urgent or violent. It is
poison, rank and deadly. The liver it attacks,
the nerves it destroys, and the digestion it
disorganises hopelessly, disastrously. To the
well-trained palate it is coarse beyond redemption.
The fictitious air of strength it lends to
the after-dinner cup delights the ignorant and
saddens the wise. But why waste too recklessly
good paper and type upon so degrading a
topic? Why not say once and for all that chicory
is impossible and revolting, an insult to the
epicure, a cruel trial to the sybarite, a crime to
the artist? Renounce it before it is too late,
and put your trust in the undrugged berries
from Arabia or Brazil, from Java or Porto
Rico. Mocha is irreproachable, though it loses
nothing when blended with Java or Mysore.</p>

<p>As the painter mixes his colours upon his
palette until the right tint springs into being,
so, if in befitting humility and patience, you
blend coffee with coffee, know that, the day is
at hand when the perfect flavour will be born
of the perfect union. From venturing to recommend
one harmony above all others, the
most daring would refrain; Mocha and Java
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
might inspire hymns of praise in Paradise; and
yet many <i>gourmets</i> would yearn for a keener,
stronger aroma, many sigh for a subtler. As
in matters of love, for yourself must you choose
and decide.</p>

<p>Sacrilegious indeed it were if, after infinite
trouble and tender care in your choice, you delivered
the blend of your heart to the indifferent
roasting pans, or cylinders, of any chance
grocer. Roast it yourself, so that the sweet
savour thereof fills your house with delicious
memories of the Eastern bazaar and the Italian
<i>piazza</i>. Roast it in small quantities, no more
at a time than may be needed for the "little
breakfast," or the after-dinner cup. And roast
it fresh for each meal. Be not led astray by
the indolent and heedless who prize the saving
of labour above the pleasures of drink, and,
without a blush of shame, would send you to a
shop to buy your berries roasted. The elect
listen not to the tempting of the profane. In a
saucepan, with lid, may the all-important deed
be done. Or else a vessel shaped for the solemn
rite may be bought. But whichever be
used, let your undivided attention direct the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
process; else the berries will be burnt. A
small piece of pure, irreproachable butter in
the pan or "drum" will prove a friendly ally.
While still hot, place the brown berries&mdash;carefully
separating those done to a turn from the
over-burnt, if any such there be&mdash;in the expectant
mill, and grind at once.</p>

<p>If much depend upon the roasting, no less is
the responsibility that rests with the grinding.
The working of the mill, soft and low as heard
from afar, makes most musical accompaniment
to dinner's later courses. It is guarantee of
excellence, certificate of merit. Thus trusted
to the mill, when time presses, none of the
coffee's essence can escape, none of its aroma.
And there is art in the grinding: ground exceeding
small it may answer for boiling, but
not for filtering or dripping; and so be wary.
If picturesqueness of preparation have charms
for you, then discard the mill and, vying with
the Turks, crush the berries in a mortar with
a wooden crusher. The difference in results,
though counted vast by the pedant, in truth
exists not save in the imagination.</p>

<p>And now collect your thoughts in all seriousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
and reverence, for the supreme moment
has come. The berries are roasted and ground:
the coffee is to be made! And how? That's
the problem to the Englishwoman to whom
good coffee is a mystery as unfathomable as
original sin or papal infallibility. How? By
a process so ridiculously easy as to be laughed
to scorn by the complex modern. In all art it
is the same&mdash;simplicity, the fruit of knowledge
and experience, is a virtue beyond compare.
But poor blind humans, groping after would-be
ideals, seek the complicated, mistaking it to be
the artistic. Arguing then, from their own
foolish standpoint, they invent strange and
weird machines in which they hope to manufacture
perfection; coffee-pots, globular in
shape, which must be turned suddenly, swiftly,
surely, at the critical instant, else will love's
labour all be lost; coffee-pots, with glass tubes
up which the brown liquid rushes, then falls
again, a Niagara in miniature; coffee-pots with
accommodating whistles blowing shrill warning
to the slothful; coffee-pots that explode, bomb-like,
at the slightest provocation; coffee-pots
that splutter, overflow, burst, get out of order,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and, in a word, do everything that is dreadful
and unseemly. Of these, one and all, fight
shy. Coffee calls not for a practical engineer
to run the machine.</p>

<p>In three ways, so simple a child may understand,
so perfect a god might marvel, can the
delectable drink, that gives wakefulness and a
clear brain, be made. In the first place, in
ordinary pot, it may be boiled, allowing a
tablespoonful of the ground berries to a cup of
water, taking the pot off the fire, once the
beautiful, seductive brown froth is formed on
the top, pouring in a small teaspoonful of water
that the grounds may settle; serve without
delay, linger over it lovingly, and then go
forth gaily to conquer and rejoice.</p>

<p>In the second place&mdash;more to be commended&mdash;use
a <i>cafétière</i>, or filter of tin or earthenware,
the latter by preference. Place the coffee,
ground not too fine, and in the same proportions,
in the upper compartment. Pour in
slowly water that is just at the boiling point, a
little only at a time, keeping the kettle always
on the fire that the all-important boiling point
may not be lost, and let the water filter or drip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
slowly through the grounds spread in a neat
layer. Some there be who stand the pot or
lower compartment in a pan of boiling water,
and they have reason with them. Others who,
when all the water has passed through to the
pot below, set it to filtering, or dripping, a second
time, and they are not wholly wrong. But
of all things, be careful that the coffee does not
cool in the process. Of life's many abominations,
lukewarm coffee is the most abominable.</p>

<p>The third of the three ways yields Turkish
coffee. The special pots for the purpose, with
their open tops and long handles, are to be
found in one or more large Regent-street and
Oxford-street shops. Get the proper vessel,
since it answers best, and is, however, a pleasure
to the eye, a stimulus to the imagination of
all who at one happy period of their lives have
dwelt in Turkey or neighbouring lands. Now,
grind your coffee finer, but be faithful to the
same proportions. Into the water drop first the
sugar, measuring it according to your taste or
mood, or leaving it out altogether if its sweetness
offend you. Put your pot on the fire, and
when the water is boiling merrily, drop in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
coffee. To a boil, as kitchen slang has it, let
it come, but gay bubbles on its surface must be
signal to lift off the pot; put it on the fire
again, almost at once, remove it bubbling a
second time, put it on again, and again remove
it. This device repeated thrice will be enough,
though a fourth repetition can do no harm. A
teaspoonful of cold water will compel unruly
grounds to settle. Pour the thick, rich, brown
liquid, as it breaks into beautiful yellow froth
on the top, into the daintiest cups your cupboard
holds, and drink it and happiness together.</p>

<p>To add cream or milk to Turkish coffee
would be a crime; nor must more sugar be
dropped into its fragrant, luscious depths. Ordinary
after-dinner coffee should also be drunk
without cream or milk, if pleasure be the
drinker's end. Indeed, a question it is whether
it be ever wise to dilute or thicken coffee
and tea with milk, however well boiled, with
cream, however fresh. The flavour is destroyed,
the aroma weakened. But black coffee
with breakfast would mean to begin the day at
too high a state of pressure, in undue exhilaration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
of spirits. To speak honestly, coffee is no
less a mistake in the morning hours than
Whisky-and-soda or Absinthe. But custom has
sanctioned it; it has become a bad habit from
one end of the Continent to the other, in innumerable
otherwise wholly decorous British
households. But slaves of habit should wear
their chains so that there is as little friction
and chafing as possible. Therefore, make your
morning coffee strong and aromatic and pure as
if destined for after-dinner delights: but pour
into it much milk; half and half would prove
proportions within reason. Not out of the way
is it to borrow a hint from provincial France
and serve <i>café-au-lait</i> in great bowls, thus tacitly
placing it forever on a plane apart from <i>café
noir</i>. Or else, borrow wisdom from wily
Magyar and frivolous Austrian, and exquisite,
dainty, decorative whipped cream heap up high
on the surface of the morning cup. Take train
to-morrow for Budapest; haunt its <i>cafés</i> and
kiosques, from the stately Reuter to the Danube-commanding
Hungaria; study their methods
with diligence and sincerity; and then, if
there be a spark of benevolence within you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
return to preach the glad gospel of good coffee
to the heathen at home. A hero you would be,
worthy countryman of Nelson and of Wellington;
and thus surely should you win for yourself
fame, and a niche in Westminster Abbey.</p>
